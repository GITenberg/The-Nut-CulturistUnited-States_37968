<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
<p>Believing that the time is opportune for making an
    effort to cultivate all kinds of edible and otherwise useful
    nut-bearing trees and shrubs adapted to the soil and
    climate of the United States, thereby inaugurating a
    great, permanent and far-reaching industry, the following
    pages have been penned, and with the hope of encouraging
    and aiding the farmer to increase his income
    and enjoyments, without, to any appreciable extent,
    adding to his expenses or labors. With this idea in
    mind, I have not advised the general planting of nut
    orchards on land adapted to the production of grain and
    other indispensable farm crops, but mainly as roadside
    trees and where desired for shade, shelter and ornament,
    being confident that when all such positions are occupied
    with choice nut-bearing trees, to the exclusion of those
    yielding nothing of intrinsic value, there will have
    been added many millions of dollars to the wealth of
    the country, as well as a vast store of edible and delicious
    food.</p>
<p>This work has not been written for the edification,
    or the special approbation, of scientific botanists, but for
    those who, in the opinion of the writer, are most likely
    to profit by a treatise of this kind. Unfamiliar terms
    have been omitted wherever simple common words
    would answer equally as well in conveying the intended
    information. There being no work of this kind published
    in this country that would serve as a guide, I
    have been compelled to formulate a plan of my own,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span> and to describe all the newer varieties from the best
    specimens obtainable, and these may not, in all cases,
    have been perfect. Under such circumstances, this
    work must necessarily be incomplete, and especially
    where the possessors of claimed-to-be new and valuable
    varieties have either refused or failed to give any information
    in regard to them. On the contrary, however,
    I must acknowledge my indebtedness to many correspondents,
    who have so generously placed specimens of
    both trees and nuts of rare new varieties in my hands
    for testing and describing, as well as assisting me in
    tracing their history and origin.</p>
<p>That this treatise may become the pioneer of many
    other and better works on nut culture is the sincere
    wish of</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>No special amount of prophetic acumen is required
    to foresee that the time will soon come when the people
    of this country must necessarily place a much higher
    value upon all kinds of food than they do at present, or
    have done in the past. In this we are pre-supposing
    that in the natural course of events, our population will
    continue to increase in nearly the same ratio it has since
    we assumed the responsibilities of an independent nation.</p>
<p>The very existence of animal life on this planet depends
    upon the quantity and quality of available food,
    and while some sentimentalists may assume to ignore
    and even attempt to deprecate the animal desires of
    their race, nature compels us to recognize the fact that
    there can be no fire without fuel, and the great and useful
    intellectual powers of man are the emanations of the
    animal tissues of a well-nourished brain. The brawny
    arm that rends the rock and hurls the fragments aside,
    gets its power through the same channel and from the
    same source as those of other members of society, whatever
    the nature of their calling; for mankind is built
    upon one universal and general plan, varied though it
    may be in some of the minor details of construction.
    We certainly have no cause to fear that the theories of
    Malthus, in regard to the overpopulation of the earth
    as a whole, will ever be verified in the experience of the
    human race, because with necessity comes industry, also
    the inventions of devices to enable us to avoid just such
    dangers, and if these fail to keep pace with our wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> and needs, wars, earthquakes, drouths, floods, and contagious,
    epidemic and other diseases, become the weapons
    which nature employs to prevent overpopulation. But
    we cannot deny that nature does sometimes encourage or
    permit a somewhat redundant population in certain
    favorable countries and localities, and then follows a
    struggle for existence, and food becomes the paramount
    object in life. To ward off danger of this kind and
    keep the supply in excess of the demand, is a problem
    which should seriously engage the attention of every
    one who takes the least interest in the general welfare of
    his countrymen, even though the day of want or scarcity
    of food may be very far distant.</p>
<p>Among the various sources of acceptable and nutritious
    food products heretofore almost entirely neglected
    in this country, the edible nuts stand preëminently and
    conspicuously in the foreground, awaiting the skill
    and attention of all who seek pleasure and profit&mdash;to
    be derived from the products of the soil. For many
    centuries these nuts have held a prominent position
    among the desirable and valuable food products of various
    European and Oriental countries; not only because
    they were important and almost indispensable in making
    up the household supplies of all classes of the people,
    but often because available for filling a depleted purse,
    and the thing needful for this purpose has, in the main,
    been received from far-distant nations, who through indifference
    and neglect failed to provide themselves with
    such a simple and valuable article as the edible nuts.</p>
<p>Much as we may boast of our immense natural resources
    and advantages, we have not, as yet, availed ourselves
    of one-half of those we possess, and the remainder
    is still awaiting our attention. We also neglect to avail
    ourselves of the many superior domestic traits and practices
    of the foreign nations with whom we are in constant
    communication. It may be that the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> incentives has made us careless and indifferent in regard
    to a day of need, which in all probability will come to
    us sooner or later; but whatever the cause, the fact remains
    that we have been spending millions annually on
    worthless articles and sentimental problems and projects,
    which have brought us neither riches nor honor; in
    truth, to use a homely phrase, we have been following
    the bellwether in nearly all of our rural affairs and pursuits.
    As a natural result we are spending millions for
    imported articles of everyday use which might easily
    and with large profit be produced at home, and in many
    instances the most humiliating part of the transaction is
    that we send our money to people who do not purchase
    any of our productions and almost ignore us in commercial
    matters. I am not referring to those products ill-adapted
    to our climate, nor to those which, owing to
    scarcity and high price of labor, we are unable to produce
    profitably, but to such nuts as the almond, walnut and
    chestnut, which we can raise as readily as peaches,
    apples and pears. There certainly can be no excuse for
    the neglect of such nut trees on the score of cost of
    labor in propagation and planting, because our streets
    and highways are lined and shaded with equally as expensive
    kinds, although they are absolutely worthless
    for any other purpose than shade or shelter, yielding
    nothing in the way of food for either man or beast.
    Can any one invent a reasonable excuse for planting
    miles and miles of roadside trees of such kinds as elm,
    maple, ash, willow, cottonwood, and a hundred other
    similar kinds, where shellbark hickory, chestnut, walnut,
    pecan and butternut would thrive just as well,
    cost no more, and yet yield bushels of delicious and
    highly prized nuts, and this annually or in alternate
    years, continuing and increasing in productiveness for one, two or more centuries. Aside from the intrinsic
    value of such trees, they are, in the way of ornament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> just as beautiful as, and in many instances much superior
    to those yielding nothing in the way of food except, perhaps,
    something for noxious insects.</p>
<p>I am not attempting to pose as the one wise man
    engaged in rural affairs, but am merely recounting my personal
    observation and experience, having in my younger
    days taken the advice of my elders, and at a time when
    a hint of the future value of nut trees would have been
    worth more than a paid-up life insurance policy. But
    as the hint was not given, I selected for roadside trees
    ash, maples, tulip, magnolias, and other popular kinds,
    all of which thrived, and by the time they were twenty
    years old began to be admired for their beauty, although
    their roots were spreading into the adjoining field, robbing
    the soil of the nutriment required for less vigorous-growing
    plants. Later, however, the discovery was
    made that I was paying very dearly for a crop of leaves
    and sentiment, neither of which was salable or available
    for filling one's purse. When thirty years of age
    the very best of my roadside trees were probably worth
    two dollars each for firewood, or one dollar more than
    the nurseryman's price at the time of planting. The
    greater part of these trees, however, have since been cremated,
    a few being left as reminders of the misdirected
    labors of youth and inexperience.</p>
<p>In this matter of following a leader in tree-planting
    along the highways, it appears to be a predominant trait
    of our rural population and as old as the settlement of
    this country, for nowhere is it more pronounced than in
    the New England States, where the American elms
    attracted the attention of the Pilgrims and their contemporaries
    and descendants, and even continued down
    to the present day. No one will deny that the
    American elm is a noble tree in appearance, is easily
    transplanted and of rapid growth, and yet it is one of
    the most worthless for any economic purpose. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> be that its worthlessness for other purposes made it all
    the more acceptable for streets and roadsides, the better
    kinds being reserved for firewood, fencing, furniture,
    and the manufacture of agricultural and other implements.
    But whatever the cause or object, the elm became
    the one tree generally selected for planting in
    parks, villages, cities, and along roadsides in the country,
    not only in the older but in many of the newer
    States. From present indications, however, the glory
    of this much over-praised tree is on the wane, for the
    imported elm-leaf beetle (<i>Galeruca calmariensis</i>) is
    slowly but surely spreading over the country, defoliating
    the elms of all species and varieties, and it is a question
    whether we should bless this insect for the work it is
    doing or look upon it as a pest. Perhaps future generations
    will sing pæons in its praise, and they certainly
    will have reasons for rejoicing if better and more useful
    kinds are planted in the places now occupied by the
    worthless elms.</p>
<p>In other localities some pioneer or leader in roadside
    ornamentation selected or recommended some species
    of maple, linden, catalpa, poplar or willow, but it
    made little or no difference as to kind, because, as a rule,
    all his neighbors followed without a thought or question
    in regard to adaptation to soil, climate, or fitness in the
    local or surrounding scenery, or of its future economic
    value. The result of this want of taste and forethought
    may be seen in whatever direction one travels throughout
    the older and more thickly settled portions of this
    country.</p>
<p>Had the early settlers of the New England States
    planted shellbark hickories, or even the native chestnut,
    in place of the American elm, they would not only have
    had equally as beautiful trees for shade and ornament,
    but the nutritious nuts would scarcely have failed to bring
    bright cheer to many a household and money to fill oft-depleted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> purses, while their descendants would have
    blessed them for their forethought. Of course there are
    other valuable kinds of nuts which thrive over the
    greater part of the New England States, but I refer only
    to the two, which were so abundant in the forests that
    one or both could have been obtained for the mere cost
    of transplanting. But it is not fair to prate about the
    remissness and follies of our ancestors, unless we can
    show by our works that wisdom has come down to us
    through their experience.</p>
<p>What is true of the New England is equally true of
    all the older States, and is rapidly becoming so in many
    of the newer, little attention being paid to the intrinsic
    value of the wood or the product of the trees planted
    along the highways. There are also millions of acres of
    wild lands not suitable for cultivation, but well adapted
    to the growth of trees, whether of the nut-bearing or
    other kinds. But for the present I will omit further
    reference to the planting of nut trees except on the line
    of the highways, just where other kinds have long been
    in vogue and are still being cultivated for shade and
    ornament,&mdash;with no thought, perhaps, on the part of
    the planter, that both could be obtained in the nut trees,
    with something of more intrinsic value added. The nut
    trees which grow to a large size are as well adapted for
    planting along roadsides, in the open country, as other
    kinds that yield nothing in the way of food for either
    man or beast. They are also fully as beautiful in form
    and foliage, and in many instances far superior, to the
    kinds often selected for such purposes.</p>
<p>The only objection I have heard of as being urged
    against planting fruit and nut trees along the highway
    is that they tempt boys and girls&mdash;as well as persons of
    larger growth&mdash;to become trespassers; but this only applies
    to where there is such a scarcity that the quantity
    taken perceptibly lessens the total crop. But where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> there is an abundance, either the temptation to trespass
    disappears, or we fail to recognize our loss. As we cannot
    very well dispense with the small boy and his sister,
    I am in favor of providing them bountifully with all the
    good things that climate and circumstance will afford.
    It is a truism that conscience is never strengthened by
    an empty stomach.</p>
<p>A mile, in this country, is 5280 feet, and if trees
    are set 40 feet apart&mdash;which is allowing sufficient room
    for them to grow during an ordinary lifetime&mdash;we get
    133 per mile in a single row; but where the roads are
    three to four rods wide, two rows may be planted, one
    on each side, or 266 per mile. With such kinds as the
    Persian walnut and American and foreign chestnuts, we
    can safely estimate the crop, when the trees are twenty
    years old, at a half bushel per tree, or 66 bushels for a
    single row, and 133 for a double row per mile. With
    grafted trees of either kind we may count on double the
    quantity named, presuming, of course, that the trees
    are given proper care. But to be on the safe side, let us
    keep our estimate down to the half-bushel mark per
    tree, and with this crop, at the moderate price of four
    dollars per bushel, we would get $264 from the crop on a
    single row, and double this sum, or $528, for the crop
    on a double row&mdash;with a fair assurance that the yield
    would increase steadily for the next hundred years or
    more; while the cost of gathering and marketing the
    nuts is no greater, and in many instances much less
    than that of the ordinary grain crops. At the expiration
    of the first half century, one-half of the trees may
    be removed, if they begin to crowd, and the timber used
    for whatever purpose it may best be adapted. The remaining
    trees would probably improve, on account of
    having more room for development.</p>
<p>There has been a steady increase in the demand,
    and a corresponding advance in the price of all kinds of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> edible nuts, during the past three or four decades, and
    this is likely to continue for many years to come, because
    consumers are increasing far more rapidly than
    producers; besides, the forests, which have long been
    the only source of supply of the native kinds, are rapidly
    disappearing, while there has not been, as yet, any
    special effort to make good the loss, by replanting or
    otherwise. The dealers in such articles in our larger
    cities assure me that the demand for our best kinds of
    edible nuts is far in excess of the supply, and yet not
    one housewife or cook in a thousand in this country has
    ever attempted to use nuts of any kind in the preparation
    of meats and other dishes for the table, as is so generally
    practiced in European and Oriental countries.</p>
<p>The question may be asked, if the demand is sufficient
    to warrant the planting of the hardy nut trees extensively
    along our highways or elsewhere. In answer
    to such a question it may be said that we not only consume
    all of the edible nuts raised in this country, but
    import millions of pounds annually of the very kinds
    which thrive here as well as in any other part of the
    world.</p>
<p>I have before me the records of our imports from
    the year 1790 to 1894, but as I purpose dealing more
    with the present and future than with the distant past,
    I will refer here only to the statistics of the four years
    of the present decade, leaving out all reference to the
    tropical nuts, which are not supposed to be adapted to
    our climate.</p>
<p>Of almonds, not shelled, and on which there is a
    protective duty of three cents per pound, we imported
    from 1890 to the close of 1893, 12,443,895 pounds, valued
    at $1,100,477.65. Of almonds, shelled, on which
    the duty is now five cents, we imported 1,326,633 pounds.
    The total value of both kinds for the four years, amounted
    to $1,716,277.32. Whether this high protective duty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> is to remain or not is uncertain, but it is quite evident
    that it has had very little effect in stimulating the cultivation
    of this nut except in circumscribed localities on
    the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>Of filberts and walnuts, not shelled, and with a
    duty of two cents per pound, we imported during the
    same years from eleven to fifteen million pounds annually,
    or a total for the four years of 54,526,181 pounds,
    and in addition about two million pounds of the shelled
    kernels, on which the duty was six cents (now four) per
    pound. The total value of these importations amounted
    to $3,176,085.34.</p>
<p>I do not find the European chestnut mentioned in
    any list of imports, although an immense quantity must
    be received from France, Italy and Spain every year,
    and they are probably imported under the head of miscellaneous
    nuts, not specially provided for, and upon
    which the duty was two cents per pound in 1890-'91,
    but was later reduced to one and a half cents.</p>
<p>Under the head &quot;miscellaneous nuts,&quot; or all other
    shelled and unshelled &quot;not specially provided for,&quot; there
    was imported during the period named 6,442,908 pounds,
    valued at $235,976.05. The total for all kinds of edible
    nuts imported was $7,124,575.82. These figures are
    sufficient to prove that we are neglecting an opportunity
    to largely engage in and extend a most important and
    profitable industry. It is true that in the Southern
    States considerable attention has been given, of late, to
    the preservation of the old pecan nut trees and the planting
    of young stock, but it will be many years before the
    increase from this source can overtake the ever-increasing
    demand for this delicious native nut. Californians
    are also making an effort to raise several foreign varieties
    of edible nuts on a somewhat extensive scale, but
    all these widely scattered experiments are mere drops in
    the ocean of our wants. Under such conditions I ask,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> in all seriousness, if it is not about time that our farmers
    and rural population generally began to count their
    worthless and unproductive possessions, in the form of
    roadside and other shade trees&mdash;which have probably
    cost fully as much to secure, plant and care for during
    the few or many years since they were set out, as would
    have been expended upon the most beautiful and valuable
    nut-bearing kinds. If our ancestors were at fault
    in the selection of trees for planting, we need not expect
    that posterity will excuse us for continuing and repeating
    their folly, especially when our dear-bought experience
    should teach us better.</p>
<p>At the present time there might be some difficulty
    in procuring, at the nurseries, a choice selection of nut
    trees in any considerable quantity, suited to roadside
    planting, because heretofore there has been little demand
    for such stock; and nurserymen are only human,
    and conduct their establishments on business principles,
    propagating the kind of trees in greatest demand, regardless
    of their intrinsic or future value to purchasers.
    They will also continue producing such stock just so
    long as the demand will warrant it, and further, it is
    but natural that they should sometimes recommend and
    advise their customers to purchase worthless, and even
    pestiferous kinds, such as the ailanthus and white poplar,
    because the profits in raising these trees are large
    and there is little danger of loss in transplanting. But
    if purchasers will insist on having better kinds and refuse
    to accept any other, they will soon be accommodated;
    and if not, then let everyone who owns a plot of
    ground become his own propagator of trees. It is not
    beyond the ability of any moderately intelligent man (or
    woman, for that matter) to raise nut trees, and as readily
    as one could potatoes or corn.</p>
<p>Where farmers want a row of trees along the roadside,
    to be utilized for line fence posts, they cannot possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> find any kinds better adapted for this purpose than
    chestnut, walnut and hickory; and these will give just as
    dense a shade, and look as well&mdash;besides, in a few years
    they may yield enough to pay the taxes on the entire
    farm, the crop increasing in amount and value not only
    during the lifetime of the planter, but that of many
    generations of his descendants.</p>
<p>This appeal to the good sense of our rural population
    is made in all sincerity and with the hope that it
    will be heeded by every man who has a spark of patriotism
    in his soul, and who dares show it in his labors, and
    by setting up a few milestones in the form of nut-bearing
    trees along the roadsides&mdash;if for no other purpose
    than the present pleasure of anticipating the gratification
    such monuments will afford the many who are
    certain to pass along these highways years hence.</p>
<p>It is surely not good policy to enrich other nations
    at the expense of our own people, as we are now doing
    in sending millions of dollars annually to foreign countries
    in payment for such luxuries as edible nuts that
    could be readily and profitably produced at home. There
    need be no fear of an overproduction of such things, no
    matter how many may engage in their cultivation, because
    in such industries many will resolve to do, and
    even make an attempt, but a comparatively small number
    will reach any marked degree of success.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE ALMOND.</h3>
<p>Amygdalus, <i>Tournefort</i>. Name supposed to be derived
    from <i>amysso</i>, to lacerate, because of the prominent
    sharp, knifelike margin of one edge of the deeply pitted,
    wrinkled nut. Martius, an Italian botanist, suggests
    that the name came from the Hebrew word <i>shakad</i>, signifying
    vigilant, or to awake, because after the rigors of
    winter the almond tree is one of the earliest to hail the
    coming of spring, with its flowers. The common English
    name is from the Latin <i>amandola</i>, corrupted from <i>amygdala</i>. In French it is <i>amandier</i>; in German, <i>mandel</i>; Portuguese, <i>amendoa</i>; Spanish, <i>almendro</i>;
    Italian, <i>amandola</i>, <i>mandalo</i>, <i>mandorla</i>, etc.; Dutch, <i>amendel</i>; Chinese, <i>him-ho-gin</i>.</p>
<p>Under the natural classification of plants the almond
    belongs to the order <i>Rosaceæ</i>, and in the tribe <i>Drupaceæ</i>.
    Linnæus placed the peach and almond in the same
    genus, and they are now generally considered to be only
    varieties of one species,&mdash;the wild almond tree is probably
    the parent from which all the cultivated peaches
    and nectarines have descended. In most of our modern
    botanical works these fruits are classed as a sub-section
    of <i>Prunus</i>, the plum. They are mainly deciduous
    shrubs, or small trees. The flowers are variable, both
    in size and color; but in the almond they are usually
    somewhat larger than in the peach, almost sessile, and
    from separate scaly buds on the shoots of the preceding
    season, appearing in early spring, before or with the
    unfolding leaves, the latter being folded lengthwise in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> the bud. Leaves three to four inches long, tapering,
    finely serrate, with few or no glands at the base of the
    blade, as seen in many varieties of the common peach.
    Fruit clothed with a fine dense pubescence in both peach
    and almond; but in the latter the pulpy envelope becomes
    dry and fibrous at maturity, cracking open irregularly,
    allowing the rough and deeply indented nuts to
    drop out; while in the peach the pulpy part becomes
    soft, juicy and edible, the reverse of the almond. The
    nectarine is only a smooth-skinned peach.</p>
<p><strong>History of the Almond.</strong>&mdash;As with most of our
    long-cultivated fruits and nut trees, very little is now
    known of the early history or origin of the almond, and
    even its native country has not been positively determined,
    although it is supposed to be indigenous to parts
    of Northern Africa and the mountainous region of Asia.
    Theophrastus, who wrote a history of plants about three
    centuries before the Christian era, mentions the almond
    as the only tree in Greece that produces blossoms before
    the leaves. From Greece it was introduced into Italy,
    where the nuts were called <i>nuces græcæ</i>, or Greek nuts.</p>
<p>Columella, about the middle of the first century of
    our era, was the earliest Roman writer to mention the
    almond as distinct from the peach. From Italy this
    nut was slowly disseminated, making its way northward
    mainly through France, reaching Great Britain as late
    as 1538 (<i>Hortus Kewensis</i>). But its cultivation has
    never extended in Britain, beyond sheltered gardens and
    orchard houses, owing to the cool and otherwise uncongenial
    climate, and the same is true of Northern France
    and other regions to the eastward in Europe. But in
    the south of France, also in Italy, Spain, Sicily, and
    throughout the Mediterranean countries, both in Europe
    and Africa, the almond thrives, and has long been extensively
    cultivated. These nuts are an important article
    of commerce, immense quantities being exported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> Spain, mainly from Valencia, while the so-called Jordan
    almond comes from Malaga, as very few are raised in
    the valley of the Jordan. Bitter almonds come principally
    from Mogador in Morocco.</p>
<p>As for almond culture in the United States, very
    little is to be said further than that, while we have few
    experiments to refer to as having been made east of the
    Rocky Mountains, not one of our great pomologists,
    in their published works, has ever given any reason for
    the almost entire neglect of this nut. Mr. Wm. H.
    White, author of &quot;Gardening for the South&quot; (1868),
    throws no light upon the subject, merely describing a
    few of the well-known varieties of the almond. Downing's
    &quot;Fruit and Fruit Trees of America,&quot; Thomas'
    &quot;American Fruit Culturist,&quot; Barry's &quot;Fruit Garden,&quot;
    and a score of other standard pomological works may be
    consulted, without obtaining therefrom any information
    in regard to the culture of this nut further than to be
    assured that the hard-shelled varieties are hardy in the
    North wherever the peach tree thrives, and the thin, or
    paper shelled, succeed only in warm climates. All these
    authors agree in saying that the propagation and cultivation
    of the almond is the same as practiced with the
    peach.</p>
<p>Coming down to recent years for information in
    regard to almond culture, we find H. E. Van Deman,
    pomologist to the Department of Agriculture, dismissing
    the subject in his report for 1892, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;I only mention this nut to state to all experimenters
        that it is useless to try to grow the almond of commerce
        this side of the Rocky mountains, except, possibly,
        in New Mexico and southwestern Texas. This is
        thoroughly established by many reports from those who
        have tried it in nearly every State and for many years
        past. It is too tender in the North and does not bear in
        the South. In California it is an eminent success.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>
    <p>&quot;The flavor of the hard-shelled almond, so far as I
        have tested it, is little or no better than a peach kernel,
        and is therefore practically worthless. The tree of this
        variety is about as hardy as the peach, and bears quite
        freely. The attention paid to the almond in the Atlantic
        and Central States might well be given to other nuts.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is certainly a very easy way of disposing of the
    cultivation of a nut which has so long figured among
    our importations from European countries; besides, no
    experiments are cited, experimenters named, or reasons
    given why almond culture is a failure in the Southern
    States. But fortunately there are men in the South
    who are able and ready to give reasons for their opinions
    and statements, in regard to the cultivation of crops or
    plants with which they have become familiar through
    personal experience. When I asked Mr. P. J. Berckmans,
    Augusta, Ga., president of the American Pomological
    Society, for information on this point, he promptly
    replied as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The reason that almonds are not cultivated in
        Georgia and other Southern States is because of their
        early blooming, as spring frosts usually destroy all the
        blossoms. We have tried many varieties of the soft-shell
        without success. The hard-shell will occasionally
        bear a crop of fruit, as it blooms later, and the blooms
        seem to resist cold better than the other varieties. In
        middle Florida soft-shell almonds are sometimes successful,
        but they have been tried so sparingly that I cannot

<p>Admitting, as we do, that President Berckmans'
    long experience in the cultivation of nut and fruit trees
    in the South enables him to speak with authority on
    this subject, still, we have some encouragement for continuing
    experiments with the almond in regions known
    to be favorable for the cultivation of its near relative,
    the peach. Furthermore, experiments seem to be wanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> with the almond in the more elevated regions of the
    northern line of Southern States, also in Maryland, Delaware
    and southern New Jersey, near the seacoast, or
    other large bodies of water, which, as is well known,
    have considerable influence in retarding the early blooming
    of fruit trees, as well as warding off late spring and
    early autumn frosts.</p>
<p>It is scarcely reasonable to suppose that a region
    of country as extensive as that of one-half of the Middle
    and all of the Southern States, with a range of climate
    admitting of the successful cultivation of such hardy
    fruits as the apple and pear, and from these down to the
    pineapple and cocoa-nut, should not yield a locality or
    localities admirably adapted to the cultivation of the
    half-hardy almond tree. It is no doubt true that there
    are extensive regions in the South where late spring
    frosts are exceedingly troublesome, and sometimes disastrously
    so, to fruit growers; but even these have their
    limits, as shown in the vast quantity and variety of
    fruits annually produced in the Southern States. But
    great local variations in climate are natural to all countries
    in the temperate zone, and we frequently find the
    most favorable and the unfavorable for fruit culture
    within a few miles of each other.</p>
<p>If there are not thousands and tens of thousands of
    acres of land located in favorable positions between Virginia
    and Florida, adapted to produce the commercial
    almond in some of its varieties, then we must confess
    that the study of climatology is of little use to the
    pomologist. Furthermore, all the varieties of the so-called
    hard-shelled almonds which thrive in our northern
    States are not worthless, neither are the kernels
    of all of them &quot;bitter,&quot; and even if they were, they
    would still be worth cultivating, else we would not
    import such vast quantities from Morocco to supply the
    demand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>If none of the thin-shelled varieties heretofore tried
    in the South are successful, it is time that either our experiment
    stations or individual horticulturists made some
    attempt to produce those that are adapted to that region
    of country. But until we have some more definite information
    than heretofore disseminated, in regard to almond
    culture in the South, it is safe to conclude that failures
    in the past have been due mainly to want of judgment,
    or knowledge of varieties and of positions for the orchard,
    with, perhaps, some neglect in care and cultivation.</p>
<p>In California almond culture has been pushed with
    vigor for several decades, but at first with rather indifferent
    results, because growers depended upon noted
    European varieties, which, as experience proved, were
    not adapted to the soil and climate of the country. In
    a paper read before the American Pomological Society
    at its session held at Sacramento, Cal., Jan. 16-18, 1895,
    Prof. E. J. Wickson, of the University of California,
    alluded to this subject of almond culture in the State as
    follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In no branch of this effort for improved varieties
        has our success been more marked than in the
        development of seedling almonds. The achievements of
        A. T. Hatch in this line are too well known to require
        but a passing allusion. It is not too much to say that
        this work rescued almond culture to California. When
        he began, the almond, because of almost universal failure
        of the old varieties, was a jest and a byword in our
        horticulture. Nine-tenths of all the almonds planted
        during the preceding twenty-five years had gone for
        firewood or were carrying the foliage of the prune to
        conceal their hated stems. At the present time, through
        the dissemination of Mr. Hatch's varieties, the almond,
        in all regions decently adapted to the tree, is productive
        and profitable and has a future.&quot;</p>

<p>That almond culture in California is rapidly becoming
    an important and successful industry, we have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> ocular demonstration in the tons of these valuable nuts
    received from there in the past few years, and placed on
    sale in Eastern markets. If one man, by his individual
    efforts, can revolutionize or establish a great industry in
    a region as large as the State of California, it is not too
    much to expect that something of the kind could be
    done elsewhere, with the combined efforts of several
    men. If the varieties heretofore tried in the East are
    unsuited to the climate, it is certainly within the range
    of probabilities that others better adapted to surrounding
    conditions can be produced. The native grape,
    raspberry and strawberry have had a history similar to
    the almond, but now all are extensively and successfully
    cultivated.</p>
<p><strong>Propagation of the Almond.</strong>&mdash;The propagation
    of the almond is identical with that of the peach: that
    is, from seed to procure new varieties, or by budding
    the more desirable ones, when obtained, upon seedling
    almond, peach or plum stocks. The half-wild hard-shelled
    almond is probably the most congenial and best
    stock for this purpose, but seedlings of the peach are
    most generally employed because the most abundant and
    cheapest. Under certain conditions, such as cold,
    heavy, moist soils, and where rather dwarfish trees are
    desired, the plum may be employed with advantage as a
    stock, but it is not to be recommended for general
    orchard culture. In mild climates seedlings of the best
    of the soft-shelled varieties may be raised and planted in
    orchards without budding, but the nuts from such trees
    are likely to be somewhat variable in size and quality,
    although the trees will usually prove to be as healthy
    and productive as those subjected to artificial modes of
    propagation. If, however, the grower desires a uniform
    product, he must resort to the usual means of obtaining
    it; that is, multiplying superior or distinct varieties by
    budding, either upon peach, almond or other stocks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> It is advisable, as well as exceedingly important, for
    all who intend or feel inclined to cultivate almonds in
    regions where the adaptation of this nut has not been
    fully established by years of practical experience, that
    seedlings should be raised in large numbers, and from
    these a selection be made to meet the requirements of
    the climate and other conditions under which they are
    to be propagated and grown. If spring frosts have been
    heretofore inimical to the cultivation of the almond,
    then the production of late-blooming varieties would be
    a remedy. There will also be variations in the season
    of ripening; some may come on too early, others far too
    late for special localities, but all these faults or variations
    may be readily overcome by raising seedlings, and
    then selecting for propagation those coming nearest fulfilling
    the requirements of local conditions or circumstances.
    It is by such experiments and means that fruit
    culture has reached its present position in this and all
    other countries, where it is practiced as an art or industrial
    pursuit. Varieties that have become exceedingly
    popular and profitable in one locality or country, may
    not have succeeded elsewhere, and this holds good with
    all cultivated plants.</p>
<p>In making experiments with the almond in regions
    where it has not been cultivated, but under conditions
    which appear to be favorable, I would certainly advise
    testing the well-known varieties first, and if these fail,
    then see what can be done in the way of producing new
    ones adapted to the locality and climate.</p>
<p><strong>Raising Seedlings for Stocks.</strong>&mdash;In warm or
    moderately mild climates the nuts, whether peach or
    almond, may be planted soon after they are gathered in
    the fall, but should the weather continue warm and
    moist the nuts will sometimes sprout prematurely and
    the young sprouts get frosted later in the season, and
    for this reason it is better to store them in a cool room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> packed in dry sand or soil, until the approach of steady
    cold weather, and then plant. Having lost choice kinds
    of nuts from being in too great haste in getting them
    into the ground in the fall, I am prompted to give this
    warning to those who have had no experience in raising
    nut trees. If not convenient to plant in the fall, nuts
    of all kinds may be packed in barrels, boxes, or similar
    vessels, mixed with or stratified with sharp sand or light
    soil, then stored in a dry, cool place,&mdash;a very cool cellar
    will answer, but in my experience, out of doors is preferable,&mdash;and
    in the shade of some evergreen tree or on
    the north side of a building, and there banked over with
    earth just sufficient to keep the nuts at an equably low
    temperature. It is advisable to have a few small holes
    in the bottom of the barrels or boxes, to insure proper
    drainage, should any considerable amount of water get
    in at the top; but this will not occur if the vessels are
    properly covered with boards when placed in position
    for winter.</p>
<p>It must also be kept in mind that mice, squirrels
    and chipmunks are fond of almonds and other kinds of
    edible nuts, and if placed where these little rodents can
    find them, they are sure to take a share, or perhaps the
    entire store, before their visits are discovered. I have
    known field mice to dig down under boxes of nuts, enlarge
    the holes left for drainage, and spend the winter
    among the chestnuts which I had put away for planting
    in spring. The safest way is to place fine wire netting
    on the bottom of the box, and then cover it with the
    same. Owing to the abundance of mice and other little
    nut-eating animals, I have never dared to plant out nuts
    in the fall, and so have always stored them in sand, but
    out of doors during the winter, and well covered with
    earth. In other localities it may be safe to sow in
    autumn, and if protection from vermin is required, coat
    the nuts with gas tar, the same as practiced by farmers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> in protecting seed corn against the attacks of crows and
    other corn-pulling birds. One pint of warm tar will be
    sufficient for a bushel of nuts, and the application is
    readily made by placing the nuts in a barrel, pouring the
    tar on them, and stirring with a stick until every nut is
    coated. To prevent the tar sticking to the hands in
    planting, dust the nuts with dry wood ashes, land plaster,
    or fine dry sand.</p>
<p>If peach stones are to be planted for stocks they
    may be put into the ground as soon as ready in autumn,
    because they are rarely disturbed by vermin; or if more
    convenient, mix with common soil, and in heaps, in the
    open ground, and leave in this position until spring,
    then pick out as they begin to sprout, and plant. The
    hard-shelled almond may be treated in the same way,
    only they are not to be handled quite as roughly as peach
    stones, and for protection it is best to put them in barrels
    or boxes, as described above.</p>
<p>When ready for planting take out the nuts and drop
    them in shallow drills, one every ten or twelve inches,
    then cover with about two inches of soil. It is to be supposed,
    of course, that a seed bed has been prepared, by
    thorough working over and enriching, if necessary, in
    advance of planting. The distance between the drills
    or rows should be sufficient to admit of cultivating the
    plants with a horse or mule, and cultivator, during the
    summer, and if this is done and the soil stirred often
    enough to keep down all weeds, the stocks should become
    large enough to admit of budding the first season;
    if not, then this operation must be deferred until the
    following year. But in case the seedlings are raised from
    choice varieties and to be left in their natural condition
    for fruiting, they may be lifted when one or two seasons
    old and set where they are to remain permanently.</p>
<p><strong>The Season for Budding.</strong>&mdash;So much depends
    upon climate, location, and variation of seasons, that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> special date or time can be given for budding trees of
    any kind, but it is always to be done while the stocks
    are in active growth, because the bark must part freely
    from the wood underneath, in order to admit of inserting
    the bud under it. If the buds are set too early in
    the season there is danger of a premature growth; that
    is, of pushing out a shoot in the fall instead of remaining
    dormant until the following spring. Under certain conditions,
    however, and for special purposes, it may be
    advisable to force the buds as soon as they have formed
    a union with the stock, but as a rule, in the propagation
    of hardy and half-hardy trees, it is better to keep the
    buds dormant during the cool or cold winter months.</p>
<p>Here in the Northern States we usually begin to
    look over our stocks during the latter part of July or
    first week in August, and note their progress and condition.
    Should they show the least signs of cessation of
    growth, we begin budding them, and push the work as
    rapidly as possible. If the season is a wet one the stocks
    may continue to grow and remain in good condition for
    budding until the middle of September; but in a dry
    season they may cease to grow in August, and it is these
    variable conditions which gives to the close observer and
    man of experience such an advantage over the novice in
    the propagation of plants. It is better to begin budding
    too early than to be a few days too late.</p>
<p>The operation called budding consists in taking a
    bud, with a small portion of the bark adjoining, from
    one plant, and inserting it in another, or in some other
    part of the same plant from which it was taken. The
    physiological principles which govern the operation are,
    that there must exist an affinity between the plant from
    which the bud is taken and the one upon which it is to
    be placed, and the nearer the relationship the more
    readily will it unite and the more perfect the union.
    For instance, the cultivated peach and almond are supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> to be of the same origin, and descendants of one
    original species; consequently there is a close relationship
    between the varieties of both sections, and their
    seedlings may be employed indiscriminately for stocks.
    The next nearest relatives in the family line are the
    plums (<i>Prunus</i>), some of which answer very well as
    stocks for the almond, although very rarely used for
    this purpose. The next group in the line of botanical
    relationship are the cherries (<i>Prunus cerasus</i>), but these
    are too far removed to be employed as stocks for either
    the peach or almond.</p>

<p>For budding are necessary a small knife for preparing
    the buds for insertion and making an incision in the
    bark of the stock to admit them; and a quantity of
    some material to tie around the stock, so as to hold the
    bud in place. Budding knives are made after various
    patterns; one that is commonly used has an ivory or
    bone handle, made very thin at the end, that is used to
    peel the bark from the stock where the bud is to be inserted
    (Fig. 2). Another form of budding knife is made
    with a horn handle, and a small tapering piece of ivory
    fastened in the end. These knives, of various shapes
    and sizes, can be had at the seed stores; but another and
    quite a different form of budding knife is shown in Fig.
    3, and is known as the &quot;Yankee budding knife.&quot; It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> merely a small one-bladed pocket knife with a thin
    blade, round at the end. The cutting portion extends
    about one-third around the end of the blade and two-thirds
    of its length, leaving the lower part dull. Although
    this form of budding knife has been in constant
    use in some of the older nurseries in this country for
    nearly a century, it does not appear to have been manufactured
    for the general trade, but only on special orders
    for nurserymen. It is so simple a knife, however, that
    with a little grinding almost any small one-bladed pocket
    knife can be transformed into one of these handy budding
    knives. The rounded end of the blade is used for
    lifting the bark, and for rapid work it is far more convenient
    than any form of knife that must be reversed in
    the hand every time a bud is inserted. In addition, a
    polished bit of steel is smoother and far less likely to
    lacerate the alburnous matter between the bark and
    wood than the best piece of bone or ivory. It may be
    said, however, that it is immaterial what form of knife
    is employed, provided it has a keen edge and is dexterously
    used.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 238px;"> <img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt="" title="" height="650" width="258" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._4" id="FIG._4">FIG. 4</a>. PREPARED SHOOT.</span> </div>
<p>The material most commonly used in times past for
    tying in the bud is the inner bark of the linden or basswood
    tree, usually called bass, and always to be procured
    in the form of mats, or as prepared from our
    indigenous basswoods and kept on sale at the seed stores.
    Recently, however, another excellent tying material has
    come into use, known in the trade as raffia or roffia. It is
    the cuticle of the Jupati palms. One species (<i>Raphia
    tædigera</i>) is a native of the lower valley of the Amazon
    and Orinoco, and another (<i>R. Ruffia</i>) of Madagascar and
    adjacent islands. Raffia is somewhat softer and more
    pliable than the ordinary bass, although it does not hold
    its form quite as well; but it is so cheap, soft and strong,
    that it has become very popular, and is extensively used
    for budding and many other purposes. But if none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> these tying materials are at hand, the inner bark of the
    persimmon, corn husks, cotton twine, woolen yarn, or
    even strips of old muslin and calico may be employed
    with equally as good results, although not as handy and
    convenient for such purposes. The amateur, with only
    a few stocks to bud, can readily
    improvise implements and materials
    for doing the work, even if
    they are not of the regulation type.
    In selecting buds, the young shoots
    of the present season's growth
    are preferred, and these should be
    taken from the most healthy and
    vigorous branches of bearing trees,
    if possible. The leaves should be
    immediately removed, not by
    breaking or pulling off with the
    hand, but by severing the leaf-stalks
    with a knife, as shown in
    Fig. 4. If the leaves have fallen
    from the twig, the buds may be
    too ripe, with some kinds of
    plants, but with the almond, and
    where only a few leaves near the
    base have dropped, all may be
    used with fair success. If there
    are any soft and immature buds
    on the upper part of the shoot, or
    any undeveloped ones at the base,
    they should be rejected. Success
    in budding depends very largely
    upon the condition of the stocks at the time the operation
    is performed. Unless the sap is flowing and in
    sufficient abundance to allow the bark to part or peel
    readily from the wood underneath, the bud is certain to
    fail. If the buds used should happen to be a little over-ripe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> or wholly dormant when placed in direct contact
    with the living tissues and the juices of the stock,
    they will absorb moisture and nutriment, and be as
    likely to unite and live as under opposite conditions.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;"> <img src="images/fig5.jpg" alt="" title="" height="400" width="180" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._5" id="FIG._5">FIG. 5</a>. INCISION FOR BUD.</span> </div>
<p>In performing the operation of budding, the following
    rules may be observed: Take the twig from which
    the buds are to be removed, in the left hand, with the
    small end pointing under the left arm; insert the knife-blade
    half an inch, or a little more, below the bud, cutting
    through the bark and a little into the wood; pass
    the knife under the bud, and bring it out
    about the same distance above it, taking off
    the bud with the bark, and a thin slice of
    wood attached, as at <i>c</i>, Fig. 4. Then, if
    using the Yankee budding knife, or one of
    similar form, let the forefinger clasp the
    lower part of the blade, make the horizontal
    incision in the stock first, and from this an
    incision downward about an inch long,&mdash;or
    it may be twice this length without doing
    any harm,&mdash;being careful not to cut too
    deep. Lift up the edge of the bark by passing
    the back of the end of the blade (without
    removing it) up to the horizontal incision.
    Lift the bark on the other side in the
    same manner, the two incisions making a wound in the
    stock resembling the letter T, as shown in Fig. 5. If
    other forms of budding knives are used, the thin end of
    the ivory handle is thrust under the bark, raising it
    sufficiently to admit the bud. The budder holds the
    bud between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand
    while making the incision in the stock; and as the knife
    leaves it he places the lower point of the bark attached
    to the bud under the bark of the stock before this falls
    back into place, and thrusts it down into position. If
    the upper end of the bark attached to the bud does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> pass completely under the bark of the stock, it must be
    cut across, so as to allow that which remains with the
    bud to fall into place and rest firmly on the wood of the
    stock, as shown in Fig. 6.</p>
<p>When the bud is in position and fitted to the stock,
    as shown, wind the raffia, or other material used, around
    the stock, both above and below, covering the entire
    incision, leaving only the bud and part of leafstalk uncovered.
    Of course experienced propagators have their
    own individual systems and modes of operation, but the
    above may be taken as a safe guide for the
    amateur budder. The ligatures should be
    loosened or removed as soon as the bud
    has become firmly united with the stock,
    which will usually be in ten or fifteen
    days, if at all. When the buds have failed,
    others may be inserted, provided, of course,
    the stocks are in condition to admit of the
    operation. Exceptions, however, may be
    made where the budding has been done so
    late in the season that the stock has ceased
    to grow by the time the buds have taken,
    and in such cases the ligatures may be left
    on later and removed any time before
    winter. In cold climates the snow, ice
    and water are likely to get in around the bud if the
    ligatures are not removed. But where the stocks are
    vigorous and the buds set early, there will be danger
    of the ligatures cutting into the bark as the stocks swell
    or increase in diameter, unless they are loosened or entirely
    removed.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 220px;"> <img src="images/fig6.jpg" alt="" title="" height="400" width="220" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._6." id="FIG._6.">FIG. 6.</a> BUD IN POSITION.</span> </div>
<p>Under ordinary circumstances budded stocks should
    not be headed back until the following spring, and then
    should be cut off two or three inches above the inserted
    bud; and when this pushes into growth, all suckers and
    sprouts below and above it should be rubbed off as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> appear, for the object is to throw the entire strength of
    the stock into this one bud, and when this has made a
    growth of two or three feet the short stump of the stock
    above the base of the shoot may be carefully removed
    with a sharp knife. This is usually done the last of
    July or first of August, which gives time for the healing
    of the wound before the close of the growing season.
    Sometimes it may be necessary to place small stakes by
    the side of these shoots for their support and to prevent
    breaking at the point of union with the stock; but
    this will rarely be necessary, except in very exposed
    situations.</p>
<p>If the young trees make a fairly good growth they
    will be ready for planting out in the orchard the following
    spring, and one-year-old almond trees are usually
    preferable for transplanting than older. It is not advisable
    to prune these young trees during the growing
    season the first summer, but allow all the side shoots or
    branches to grow unchecked, for by so doing we secure
    a more stocky plant, if not as tall a one, than we would
    if trimming up was practiced. But when the trees are
    taken up for transplanting, in the late fall or early
    spring, then they may be pruned and the lateral
    branches cut off close to the main stem, leaving a naked
    rod, and if low-headed trees are desired (and they usually
    are), cut back the main stem to about three feet
    from the ground. If the young trees have made a
    growth of from four to six feet, then prune away the
    lateral branches to a hight of three feet or a little more,
    and cut in all branches above this point to within four
    to six inches of the main stem, leaving the buds on these
    stumps to form the head of the tree. Four or five
    branches at the top of the stem will be sufficient for the
    foundation for an open, round-headed tree, or in what
    may be termed a vase form, which is the best for
    almonds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Soil and Exposure for Almonds.</strong>&mdash;The almond
    requires a warm, rather light and well-drained soil.
    Cold, heavy clays, and low, moist soils, whether light or
    heavy, are always to be avoided for the almond and
    closely allied trees. That the soil should be moderately
    rich is, of course, a condition required with all cultivated
    nut and fruit trees, but over-stimulation may result
    in excessive and immature growth late in the season,
    this leaving the twigs in such a state that they will
    be unable to resist even a few degrees of frost, to which
    they may be subjected the ensuing winter. In what are
    generally termed mild climates, or where the temperature
    seldom goes more than four to six degrees below the
    freezing point, hardy trees, if they have made a late
    growth, are often injured more than they would have
    been in a colder climate, with early matured wood.
    There are many kinds of what we consider very hardy
    trees and shrubs here in the North, that are very likely
    to be winterkilled or severely frosted when grown at
    the South, simply because the conditions are such that
    they do not ripen up in time to resist the cold.</p>
<p>In touching upon the subject of location for an
    almond orchard east of the Mississippi, I should be
    inclined to relegate this valuable nut to semi-tropical
    Florida, were it not for the fact that almost a score of
    ornamental species and varieties of the same genus,&mdash;to
    say nothing of the widely cultivated peach,&mdash;flourish
    over a very wide range of country and climate, and
    nowhere better than near the Atlantic ocean in the Middle
    and some of the Northern States. It is also generally
    conceded that several of what are called hard-shelled
    varieties thrive and bear fruit in nearly all of our best
    peach-growing regions. From all that I have been able
    to learn of almond culture, and with my own limited
    experience with this nut, experiments are wanting to
    prove that it cannot be successfully cultivated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> peach-growing region of the Eastern States. I will not
    say &quot;profitably&quot; cultivated, for this is a rather vague
    term when applied to horticultural operations of any
    kind. Success is not synonymous with profit; in fact,
    it is frequently quite the opposite, and an abundant
    crop may mean glutted markets and a corresponding
    loss to the producer. But, to return to location, the
    principal cause of failure in almond culture, where it
    has been tried in the older States, seems to be the early
    blooming of the trees and subsequent destruction of the
    embryo fruit by frosts. To avoid this, high, open, airy
    situations, and even the north side of hills, would certainly
    be preferable to southern slopes and protected
    locations, especially in the South or where the temperature
    in winter does not go low enough to kill the wood
    of the previous season's growth. Theoretically, we might
    suppose that there are many locations favorable to almond
    culture in the elevated regions of North Carolina
    and Tennessee, as well as in the northern tier of counties
    in Alabama and Georgia. But in the absence of carefully
    conducted experiments in these regions, we have only to
    wait for their consummation at some future time, to
    prove the truth or falsity of our theory.</p>
<p>In the rich, warm valleys of New Mexico, Arizona
    and California, congenial locations are plentiful, inasmuch
    as almost every variety of climate is at hand, with
    a temperature ranging from that of perpetual summer
    to the opposite extreme, and all to be found within a
    few miles, and frequently to be found in the same
    county. Under such conditions, it rests with the would-be
    cultivator to decide upon the kinds of fruits desired,
    then to seek a location best adapted to his purpose.</p>
<p>If, as claimed,&mdash;but not proven,&mdash;there are no
    limited or extended areas fitted for almond culture east
    of the Mississippi river, there are certainly plenty of such
    west of it, awaiting the industrious and intelligent nut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> culturist. Almond orchards have been planted in California
    and Arizona, and the quality of the nuts, as well
    as the quantity, is very satisfactory; but a greater
    number and more extensive orchards are needed to meet
    the home demand.</p>
<p><strong>Planting and Pruning.</strong>&mdash;In planting and pruning
    the almond tree the same system should be adopted
    as with its near relative, the peach. One-year-old budded
    trees are preferred for planting in an orchard, to
    older, except in the case of seedlings, then two-year-old
    may be selected, because these are seldom larger than
    one-year budded trees. The trees should be set fifteen
    to eighteen feet apart, varying the distance according to
    variety, soil, and other local conditions, and it is best to
    place them in rows and at right angles, in order to admit
    of cultivating both ways, as it is termed, thereby
    saving as much hand labor as possible. For the first
    two or three years after planting, all weeds and grass
    should be kept away from the stems and over the roots,
    either by frequent hoeing, or covering with a mulch.
    The best way, perhaps, to prevent the growth of weeds,
    is to use the land among the trees for some low-growing
    crops, such as beans, tomatoes, melons or potatoes, then
    see that the workmen, when hoeing these crops, hoe up
    the weeds and grass about the trees at the same time.
    We might reasonably suppose that the most careless cultivator
    of trees would think of this, but, unfortunately,
    extended observation proves quite the contrary, and it
    is scarcely possible to go through any very extensive
    fruit-growing region without seeing many such instances
    of neglect. A square yard or more of tough sward is
    frequently left for years undisturbed about the stems
    of all the trees in an orchard, while the little annual
    plants growing near by, and not worth, at an extreme
    valuation, five cents each, are cultivated with the greatest
    care.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<p>The first pruning of the trees should be done at the
    time of transplanting from the nursery rows, as directed
    on a preceding page, and from the top of the stem only
    three or four shoots allowed to grow the first season, all
    others being rubbed off as soon as they appear, or when
    they have made a growth of two or three inches. These
    three or four upper branches are to become the foundation
    of the future head of the tree, and should be allowed
    to grow unchecked the first season; the next spring cut
    back one-half to two-thirds of their original length.
    This pruning will force out strong side or lateral shoots
    near the base, thus giving a sturdy foundation to build
    upon later, the pruner keeping in mind that the weaker
    the growth the more severe should be the pruning.
    Better leave a few strong buds, from which vigorous
    shoots will be produced, than a great number succeeded
    by many feeble twigs. If blossoms and fruit appear on
    the young two-year-old trees, a limited number may be
    left to mature, although no considerable crop ought to
    be gathered before the third year.</p>
<p>In after years a somewhat different system of pruning may be adopted, keeping
    in view the fact that the fruit buds and fruit are always produced on the young
    shoots of the previous season&#39;s growth, and for this reason an annual renewal of
    such parts of the tree is absolutely required, in order to secure a good crop on
    trees of any age. In some localities and countries it may be possible that
    almond trees produce a crop every year; but this is scarcely to be expected
    anywhere. Consequently a system of pruning should be followed which will conform
    to the variations of circumstances and conditions; and this brings us to the
    consideration of&mdash;</p>
<p><strong>The Proper Time to Prune.</strong>&mdash;If the growth of
    the trees and their fruiting were always uniform, then
    we might readily adopt some invariable system and season
    for pruning; but as we are dealing with uncertainties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> our rules must be equally flexible and variable. If the
    season is favorable, and the trees bloom freely and fruit
    sets abundantly, we may proceed to prune as soon as
    the embryo nuts are as large as peas,&mdash;but only cutting
    back some of the largest bearing shoots, and thinning
    out others here and there, just enough to equalize and
    evenly distribute the crop through the head of the tree.
    But in case the frost or cold of winter has destroyed
    the crop for the season, then as soon as this is discovered,
    prune and cut back all the shoots and branches
    sufficient to insure a vigorous growth of young bearing
    wood for the ensuing year. Under this system of pruning
    we fix the time as after blooming in the spring, in
    order to have our work correspond to circumstances and
    conditions, and where there is a crop in prospect the
    pruning is comparatively light; but if there is to be no
    fruit, or but little, then one should aim to produce an
    abundance of bearing shoots for the following season.
    In other words, we prune severely in non-bearing years,
    whether they occur alternately or otherwise; but this
    system is only applicable to trees like the almond and
    peach, which produce their fruit on the shoots of the
    preceding year's growth.</p>
<h3>VARIETIES OF THE ALMOND.</h3>
<p>Almonds are usually divided into three groups, viz.:
    Bitter, hard-shelled, and soft, or paper-shelled. In
    each there are many varieties, although they are
    rarely known in market except by the general name
    of the group to which they belong. If they are soft,
    hard or bitter, this is sufficient designation for commercial
    purposes, with, perhaps, the addition of the name
    of country in which they were grown, or that of the
    city or seaport from whence exported.</p>
<p><strong>Bitter Almond</strong>, <i>Amygdalus communis amara</i>.&mdash;The
    varieties of this group are not specifically distinct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> and some have soft, thin shells, while others are thick
    and hard; but the kernels are very bitter, hence the
    name. But in the countries where these almonds are
    most extensively cultivated, as in the South of France,
    Austria, Spain and Greece, the trees are generally raised
    from the nut, and, as might be expected, the crop produced
    under such conditions is exceedingly variable, the
    nuts being large or small, and the shells of various degrees
    of hardness, with an occasional tree producing
    both bitter and sweet kerneled nuts. These wilding
    trees are, in the main, more hardy than the improved
    varieties, hence are largely employed as stocks for the
    better sorts, as well as for the plum and apricot. It is
    also claimed that, as a rule, the bitter almond trees
    bloom later in the spring than those of the other two
    groups, and for this reason are not so liable to be injured
    by spring frosts. The trees are hardy in all of our most
    favorable peach-growing regions of the Middle and
    Northern States, but some of the varieties ripen rather
    too late for localities north of the latitude of New York
    city. All this, however, and other obstacles, will soon
    disappear, whenever the time arrives for our horticulturists
    to take up almond culture and pursue it with half
    the zeal they have the cultivation of the peach and many
    other kinds of fruits.</p>
<p><strong>Hard-Shelled Almond</strong>, <i>A. c. dulcis</i>, or sweet-kerneled
    almond.&mdash;The varieties of this group, as a
    whole, differ from those of the next only in the firmness
    of their shells, which are moderately firm, with a slightly
    rough and deeply pitted surface, as shown in Fig. 7.
    Varieties of this group are fully as large as, and perhaps
    a little longer than the thin-shelled, and the kernels are
    fully as valuable when removed and sold as shelled
    almonds. It may require a little more labor to crack
    and remove the kernels for market, but the difference is
    scarcely worth taking into consideration by the grower.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>
<p>The common sweet, hard-shelled almond thrives in
    peach-growing regions as far north as Central New York,
    and I well remember of seeing trees loaded with these
    nuts, in my boyhood days, in the western part of the
    State. The late Patrick Barry, in the Fruit Garden,
    when referring to this nut, says: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;This is a hardy and
        productive tree, succeeding well in the climate of Western
        New York, and still farther north. Nut very large,
        with a hard shell and a large sweet kernel; ripe here
        (Rochester) about the first of October.
        The tree is very vigorous, has
        smooth, glaucous leaves, and when
        in bloom in the spring is more brilliant
        and showy than any other fruit
        tree.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nearly every one of our noted
    horticulturists who have said anything
    about almond culture in the
    North, agree with Mr. Barry in regard
    to the beauty of this tree and
    its productiveness; but it is well to
    keep in mind that it is no more to
    be depended upon than the peach, and the barren years
    will far outnumber the bearing ones. But the almond
    is probably as certain here as in France, where it is cultivated
    extensively as an article of commerce, although
    a full crop once in about five years is about all that is
    expected. We can probably do much better than this,
    especially if proper attention is given to the production
    of new varieties adapted to our climate, as has been done
    in California with the almond, and here in the East with
    the peach and many other kinds of fruits; and when
    such have been secured, proceed to multiply them in the
    usual mode of budding upon seedling stocks.</p>
<p><strong>Soft, or Brittle-Shelled</strong>, <i>A. c. fragilis</i>.&mdash;In
    this group we have many distinct varieties, besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> others which are known by local names, but have no
    permanent and pronounced distinguishing characteristics
    that would aid in separating them, should this be
    desired. The most common form, widely known as the
    sweet-kerneled thin-shelled (Fig. 8), is one of the oldest
    in cultivation in European countries.
    The flowers usually appear with the
    leaves, or before they unfold, and are
    large and of a pale rose color. The
    tree is rather tender for latitudes north
    of Philadelphia, but succeeds southward,
    and westward to the Pacific,
    if late frosts do not come to destroy
    the flowers or embryo nuts.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 216px;"> <img src="images/fig8.jpg" alt="" title="" height="350" width="216" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a name="FIG._8" id="FIG._8">FIG. 8.</a> THIN-SHELLED
    ALMOND.</span></span> </div>
<p><strong>Large Fruited Almond</strong>, <i>A. c.
    macrocarpa</i>.&mdash;This is an old French
    variety, and perhaps most widely
    known as the Sultana, although the
    latter name is often applied in market to almost every
    variety of sweet almond. The leaves of the genuine
    variety are much broader than those of the preceding
    groups, and are smooth and deep green. Flowers very
    large and showy, of a pale rose color, and always appear
    in spring before the leaves, and for this reason it has long
    been cultivated in England as an ornamental tree. Fruit
    large, depressed or flattened at the base, but pointed at
    the top. Shell rather hard and firm, and will withstand
    rough handling and transportation long distances. Kernel
    very sweet and tender, hence highly prized everywhere.
    There are several sub-varieties; one, known as
    the Pistache almond, is highly esteemed for the table,
    on account of its delicate flavor, although it is very small
    and not popular for commercial purposes.</p>
<p><strong>The Peach Almond</strong>, <i>A. c. persicoides</i>.&mdash;This is
    another old variety, described by Du Hamel about the
    middle of the last century, under the name of <i>Amandier-Pecher</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> or peach-leaved almond. Leaves similar to those
    of the common peach. Fruit ovate, obtuse; husk
    slightly succulent; shell of a yellowish color, and the
    kernel sweet-flavored and excellent. Du Hamel says
    the fruit varies widely, even upon the same tree or
    branch, some having a dry, thin husk, while on others
    it is soft and fleshy, somewhat like that of the peach.
    As the almond and peach are of the same species, it
    would not be at all strange if an occasional variety raised
    from the seed of either class should diverge towards, or
    even pass completely over to a closely allied group.</p>
<p>From the varieties found in the forementioned
    groups we must seek to find, or produce therefrom, those
    which will succeed in this country wherever it may be
    thought desirable to attempt the cultivation of this nut.
    So far as my knowledge extends, no attempts have, as
    yet, been made to produce distinct American varieties in
    the Eastern States, as with its near relative, the peach,
    but all the almonds thus far cultivated here are of well-known
    foreign varieties. Perhaps the demand for
    almond trees has not been sufficient heretofore to encourage
    very extended experiments in this direction, but
    I cannot believe that our people will continue for another
    century to import millions of pounds annually of
    almonds if it is possible to raise them in this country.
    That it is possible on the Pacific coast has already been
    fully demonstrated, but we want to see the field greatly
    enlarged, and give the people of the Eastern States a
    share in what is evidently soon to become a large and
    profitable industry.</p>
<p><strong>Ornamental Varieties of the Almond.</strong>&mdash;These
    are only referred to because some of the many in cultivation
    belong to the groups producing the most valuable
    nuts, but the greater part of the purely ornamental varieties
    are worthless for other purposes. <i>Amygdalus cochinchinensis</i> grows to quite a large tree in its native country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> or thirty to forty feet high; flowers small, white,
    produced in long racemes; tender.<i> A. orientalis</i>, a
    small shrub, with grayish or hoary leaves, and small
    rose-colored flowers; sometimes cultivated under the
    name of <i>argentea</i>, or Silvery almond. <i>A. incana</i> (hoary)
    is another dwarf species, from the Caucasus, with solitary
    red flowers. <i>A. nana</i> and <i>A. pumila</i> are oriental species
    of very dwarf shrubs, with either red or white flowers.
    The double-flowering varieties of these have long
    been inhabitants of our gardens.</p>
<p><strong>Properties and Uses.</strong>&mdash;For domestic purposes
    the almond is highly esteemed wherever it is known,
    and is employed in hundreds of different ways in the
    preparation of appetizing dishes and dainties for the
    table. In countries where this nut is in cultivation, it
    is brought to the table in the half-opened green husk,
    for at this time the kernels are just passing from the
    milky stage, and are considered more readily digested
    than later, or when fully ripe. But it is only when they
    are fully mature that they are gathered for market, and
    after thorough drying they are placed in strong sacks
    and distributed among dealers in all parts of the world.
    But only certain varieties are exported in this condition,
    and principally those with very thin shells, because
    these are most in demand, for the table and dessert,
    where the almond is not a home product. Other sweet
    varieties, whether with very hard or very tender shells,
    are cracked and only the kernels exported. The importation
    of shelled almonds into this country is somewhat
    in excess of the unshelled, and as they are of
    greater value per pound, the duty levied is proportionally
    higher. There is also a great saving to the importer
    and consumer,&mdash;not only in freight, but the extraction of
    the kernels is done in countries where labor is abundant
    and cheap. Whether the almond shells are used for
    any purpose in European countries, or are considered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> wholly a waste product, I have been unable to learn, but
    it is asserted, and by men whose word is worthy of
    credence, that almond shells ground into a fine golden
    colored flour, is much used in this country for adulterating
    red pepper, cinnamon and other spices.</p>
<p>Almonds are not only used extensively at all times
    and seasons, by persons of all ages and sexes, at table
    and elsewhere, but they are employed largely in the
    making of fancy confectionery with sugar, or in the form
    of salted almonds, the kernels having been first thoroughly
    steamed or scalded, to remove the skin, and then
    rolled or dusted with fine salt. Prepared in this way
    they are usually considered more readily digestible and
    healthful than in their natural state.</p>
<p>Sweet almonds are also valued in the form of emulsions,
    as a medicine in pulmonary disorders, and the oil
    of almonds is a common standard article in the stock of
    druggists everywhere, as it enters into the composition
    of cosmetics, syrups, pastes and powders of various
    kinds.</p>
<p>The kernels of the wild bitter almond contain a
    poisonous principle known as hydrocyanic or Prussic
    acid, which does not exist in the sweet varieties, although
    found in their leaves and the bark of their twigs. But
    as bitter almonds are not palatable, there is little danger
    of anyone being poisoned from eating them, should
    these nuts ever be cultivated here for any special purpose,
    as in other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Insects and Diseases.</strong>&mdash;Whenever the almond
    tree becomes common here in orchards it will doubtless
    suffer from the attacks of the same kinds of natural enemies
    as affect the peach. One of the most widely distributed
    of these pests is the common peach-tree borer.
    The parents of these borers are small, slender-bodied,
    bluish, transparent-winged moths, the male somewhat
    smaller than the female. These moths usually appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> in this latitude during the month of June, and the
    female deposits her eggs on the stems of the trees near
    the surface of the ground, or a little below it if she can
    find a convenient opening to suit her purpose. The
    eggs deposited soon hatch, and the young larvæ bore
    through the tender bark at this point, and when fairly
    under it, branch off, cutting galleries through the soft
    alburnum underneath. When a number of these borers
    are at work on the same tree they sometimes girdle and
    kill it the first season, especially if it is young or a small
    specimen. But if the tree is not killed outright it will
    show, by the check to its growth, that borers are at
    work. The borers continue feeding throughout the
    remainder of the season, and up to the time freezing
    weather sets in for the winter, and if not full grown at
    this time they will finish their growth early in spring,
    then crawl to near the outside, or just under the old
    bark, and there spin a thin cocoon, in which they are
    transformed to the pupal stage, remaining in this form
    for a few weeks, then issuing in the winged or moth
    stage.</p>
<p>In the line of preventives and remedies there is
    nothing better than clean cultivation about the trees,
    and annual examination of each tree early in summer
    and the crushing of every borer found. The next best
    thing, in the way of a preventive, is to wrap the stems
    from a little below the surface of the ground to a foot or
    more above it with heavy paper, cloth, or bark of some
    kind, to keep the moth from laying her eggs on the bark
    of the tree. I have used common tar paper for this
    purpose, not only because it is very cheap and does not
    decay when exposed to the weather, but the exhalation
    or odor of tar seems to be offensive to the moths. In
    the use of this material I have never found that it was
    in the least injurious to the bark underneath. Painting
    the stems with soap, cement, clay, or even common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> mineral paints, will answer very well if a little care is
    given to keeping down the number of insects by removing
    the larger part of the borers with knife or gouge.</p>
<p>In recent years a pest known as the &quot;shot-hole
    borer&quot; (<i>Scolytus rugulosus</i>) has appeared in many and
    widely separated localities, in both the Eastern and
    Western States, attacking the almond, peach and plum
    tree. It is supposed to have been introduced from
    Europe with imported nursery stock, and thence rapidly
    distributed, by similar means, through the country. In
    its perfect stages it is a minute brown beetle, about one-twelfth
    of an inch long and one-thirtieth of an inch in
    diameter. This pest appears about midsummer, boring
    numerous minute holes through the bark and into the
    sapwood underneath, and in this the female deposits
    her eggs, and from these are hatched the little grubs
    found later feeding on the soft inner bark and alburnous
    matter beneath it. From every hole made in the bark
    a small globule of gum will soon appear, drying upon
    the surface&mdash;thence onward until autumn&mdash;and glistening
    in the sun, an immutable sign of the presence of a
    minute but destructive enemy.</p>
<p>When the beetles and their eggs are once in possession
    there is no practical way known of removing them,
    and the best thing to be done is to cut down and burn
    every infested tree, and just as soon as it is known to be
    in this condition. There are also several indigenous
    species of bark beetles, which will very likely attack
    almond trees as soon as they are as abundant as peach
    trees, but all may be destroyed with the same, or very
    similar weapons and materials.</p>
<p>What are called preventives consist mainly of substances
    to be applied to the stems in a semi-liquid form,
    and of such a nature as to be offensive to the beetles
    because of their odor, taste, or because so hard that the
    insects cannot cut through them with their mandibles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> Common lime whitewash, soft soap, whale-oil soap, or a
    thin mineral paint made of pure linseed oil, will answer
    very well for this purpose if applied often enough to
    keep the bark constantly coated.</p>
<p>Of the fungous diseases affecting the almond in this
    country, very little is as yet known, although we may
    safely include under this head all those that have been
    inimical to the peach, for the transition from this tree
    to the almond would only be a natural sequence. The
    peach-leaf curl (<i>Taphrina deformans</i>) would not be far
    from home on the almond leaf, neither could we expect
    that almond orchards would be wholly exempt from
    that mysteriously distributed and uncontrollable disease
    known as &quot;peach yellows.&quot;</p>
<p>In California an almond-leaf blight has already appeared
    and seriously affected the trees in some of the
    orchards. It is caused by a fungus known as <i>Cercospora
    circumscissa</i> Sacc. This fungus attacks the leaves and
    young twigs, causing the former to fall off early in the
    season, thereby checking the growth of the tree and preventing
    the maturing of the fruit. It is thought that
    remedies may be applied to check this disease, and there
    will probably be some form of copper solution employed
    for destroying it, as with various species of fungi on other
    kinds of fruit trees.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE BEECHNUT.</h3>
<p>Fagus, <i>Linn.</i> The Beech. The Latin name of the
    genus (<i>Fagus</i>) supposed to be an equivalent of the Greek
    phegos, an oak, or it may be derived from <i>phago</i>, to eat;
    the nuts of this tree having been used as food by man
    in all ages and countries where it is a native. The
    modern English name, beech, was probably derived
    from the Anglo-Saxon <i>bece</i> or <i>boc</i>; in Dutch it is <i>beuk</i>;
    French, <i>hetre</i>; Icelandic, <i>beyk</i>; Danish, <i>bog</i>; Swedish, <i>bok</i>; German, <i>buche</i> or <i>buoche</i>; Russian, <i>buk</i>; Italian, <i>faggio</i>; Armenian, <i>fao</i>; and in Welsh <i>ffawydd</i>.</p>
<p>The beech belongs to the order <i>Cupuliferæ</i>, or oak
    family. The genus contains about fifteen species of
    handsome deciduous and evergreen trees, or shrubs, very
    widely distributed throughout the temperate and colder
    regions of both the northern and southern hemispheres.
    Male flowers are bell-shaped, in long-stalked drooping
    heads; calyx five to seven cleft, containing numerous
    stamens. Female flowers two to four in a cluster on the
    summit of the scaly-bracted peduncle; the inside scales
    uniting, forming a four-lobed involucre of imbricated
    bracts, the whole becoming at maturity a somewhat
    prickly, scaly bur, within which are found a pair of
    sharp-edged triangular nuts, containing a tender and
    sweet-flavored kernel.</p>
<p><strong>History of the Beech.</strong>&mdash;The common beeches of
    both Europe and North America are so closely related
    that the two species may be considered as one for all
    practical purposes, such as propagation, cultivation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> value of the wood and nuts. It is true, however, that
    our native beech is not environed with ancient myths
    and stories of love and war, neither is it celebrated in
    poetry and song, yet it has, doubtless, played just as
    noble a part in human affairs among the pre-historic
    races of America as those recorded of its European contemporary.
    As the beech in Europe is found in the
    forests of Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany,
    and southward to Constantinople, Palestine, Asia
    Minor and Armenia, it was well known and highly appreciated
    by all the early inhabitants of these countries,
    and is frequently referred to by the earlier writers of
    Greece and Rome who touch upon the rural affairs of
    their times. It is supposed that Theophrastus refers to
    the beech under the name of <i>Oxua</i>, and Dioscorides
    as <i>Phegos</i>, and the latter author places it among the
    oaks, in which he was not far out of the way, because
    the beech is a member of the oak family in our modern
    classification. Virgil and Pliny speak highly of the
    little triangular nuts, and the people of their times set
    considerable value upon beech-nuts as an article of food.
    Pliny also assures us that at the siege of Chios, the besieged
    inhabitants lived for some time entirely on these
    nuts. We are inclined to think, however, that both
    Virgil and Pliny are in error when they tell us that
    the beech was propagated by being grafted on the
    chestnut. They were probably led astray in this by
    some romancing gardener of their time, for we even
    have some of the same ilk with us at this day. Pliny
    refers to the beech several times in his writings, and
    places a much higher value upon this nut than he does
    upon the chestnut; in fact, speaks rather contemptuously
    of the latter, and seems to be surprised that nature
    should have taken such care of the nuts, which he calls
    &quot;<i>vilissima</i>,&quot; as to enclose them with a prickly involucre
    or bur.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<p>But my limited space will not allow of tracing the
    history of the beech from ancient to modern times,
    although it has always been esteemed as food for man,
    as well as for wild and domesticated animals. Swine fattened
    on beech and oak mast have for ages been noted
    for their excellent flesh, and the value of many an old
    estate in Great Britain was determined more upon the
    mast the forest produced, than the area or number of
    square miles they contained.</p>
<p>As a monumental tree the beech has no rival, for
    its smooth gray bark, perennial and almost unchangeable,
    has ever been a convenient place to register challenges
    to enemies, epitaphs, epithets, and probably more
    frequently than all, the initials of the name of some
    loved one, who might possibly pass that way and find
    her name engraved on the beechen tree. I doubt much
    if there is a beech grove in all Europe or in America,
    within a convenient distance of a city, country village or
    schoolhouse, on which the bark of the trees is not scarified
    by the knives of boys in recording the initials of
    their own names, and those of their favorites of the opposite
    sex. These living registers were long ago recognized
    by the poets, and more than eighteen centuries
    ago Virgil admits it in these lines:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20%">&quot;Or shall I rather the sad verse repeat,<br />
    Which on the beech's bark I lately writ.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p>In more modern times Tasso hints of the same habit,
    in <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>, to wit:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20%">&quot;On the smooth beechen rind, the pensive dame<br />
    Carves in a thousand forms her Tancred's name.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p>That the Spanish youths were not oblivious to their
    opportunities for recording the names of their favorites
    we must assume to be true, from the lines of Don Luis
    de Gongora, who tells us that:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20%">&quot;Not a beech but bears some cipher,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Tender word, or amorous text.</span><br />
    If one vale sounds Angelina,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Angelina sounds the next.&quot;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Propagation of the Beech.</strong>&mdash;The beech, in all
    its species and varieties, may be propagated by the usual
    modes, viz.: By seed, layers, budding and grafting.
    The seeds, when gathered, should be mixed with clean,
    sharp, moist sand, placed in boxes, and then stored in a
    cool or cold place and carefully protected from mice,
    until the time arrives for sowing in spring. They may
    also be sown in the fall and lightly covered with leaf
    mold or other light soil, but unless coated with tar or
    some offensive poisonous substance, vermin of some
    form will be very likely to find them and leave few
    to grow. Seedlings are used for stocks upon which
    to work the many varieties in cultivation; but as I
    am not writing this for the encouragement of propagators
    of purely ornamental trees, I will omit giving
    any very extended description of the different modes
    of propagating the beech, further than to say that
    should remarkably fine varieties with extra-sized nuts be
    discovered or produced, they can be perpetuated and
    multiplied by the same processes adopted for other kinds
    of nut trees.</p>
<p><strong>Soil and Location.</strong>&mdash;The beeches of Northern
    countries, in their many varieties, thrive best in a cool,
    moist soil, for their roots rarely penetrate very deeply, but
    spread out widely and near the surface, forming an intricate
    network, which will try the patience of the woodman
    who attempts to clear away a forest of beech and
    break up the ground. In this country, as well as in
    Europe, the beech thrives in calcareous soils, or what is
    usually termed limestone regions; consequently, when
    transplanted or raised in sandy soils, or on the red sandstone
    formation, light applications of lime are usually
    found very beneficial; but more than all, the beech requires
    moisture, and if not planted in a moist soil the
    surface over the roots should be kept constantly covered
    with some kind of mulch.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Species and Varieties of the Beech.</strong>&mdash;In the
    Dictionary of Gardening, edited by George Nicholson,
    of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, the following
    species of Fagus are briefly described, viz:</p>
<p><i>F. antarctica.</i>&mdash;Leaves ovate, blunt, glabrous, attenuated
    at the base, doubly dentate, alternate, petiolate,
    one and a half inches long. A small deciduous tree or
    shrub, with rugged, tortuous branches. Native of Tierra
    del Fuego, S. A.</p>
<p><i>F. betuloides</i> (birch-like). Evergreen beech.&mdash;Leaves
    ovate, elliptic, obtuse crenulate, leathery, shining
    glabrous, round at the base or short footstalks. An
    evergreen tree, native of Tierra del Fuego, S. A.</p>
<p><i>F. ferruginea</i> (rusty). American beech.&mdash;Leaves
    ovate, acuminate, thickly toothed, downy beneath, ciliate
    on the margin. A large deciduous tree, very closely
    resembling the common European species, from which
    it is distinguished by its longer, thinner and less shining
    leaves.</p>
<p><i>F. obliqua</i> (oblique). Chile beech.&mdash;Leaves ovate,
    oblong, oblique, somewhat rhomboid, blunt, doubly serrated,
    entire at the base, attenuated into the petiole, and
    somewhat downy. A hardy deciduous tree, native of
    the cooler elevated regions of Chile, S. A.</p>
<p><i>F. sylvatica</i> (sylvan). European beech.&mdash;Leaves oblong,
    ovate, obscurely toothed; margin ciliate. A well-known
    large deciduous tree, widely distributed in Europe
    from Norway southward to Asia Minor. From this species
    a large number of ornamental varieties have been
    produced, many of them merely accidental variations of
    the wild forms of the forests, while others have originated
    in the seedbeds of nurserymen. But so far as I am
    aware, no variety has ever been introduced bearing
    superior or improved forms of nuts.</p>
<p>Our American beech (<i>F. ferruginea</i>) is a widely
    distributed tree, extending from Nova Scotia in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> north, south to Florida, and westward to Wisconsin and
    Missouri. Formerly it was exceedingly abundant, but
    like many other of our most valuable forest trees, it is
    disappearing before the axe of the woodman, who has
    always found a ready sale for beech timber. It is used in
    the manufacture of plane stocks, shoe lasts, handles for
    paring chisels, and hundreds of similar articles. Beech
    wood is hard, firm, and takes a good polish, but is not
    very flexible. It makes excellent fuel, and ranks next
    in value to hard maple and hickory for this purpose.
    In the more northern States and where the beech grows
    to its largest size, the heartwood is usually of a reddish
    color; but here in New Jersey and farther south, the
    wood is usually white almost to the center of the tree,
    no matter how large it may be. The color of the wood,
    however, does not in any way detract from its value, for
    fuel and many other purposes, although some European
    dendrologists have been deceived into supposing that the
    white beech was almost or quite worthless. Loudon, in <i>Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum</i>, Vol. III, in referring
    to our beech, says: &quot;The wood of the white
    beech is little valued in America, even for fuel; and
    the bark is used for tanning, but is little esteemed,&quot; etc.
    But if any one, in these later years, has had occasion to
    purchase beech timber for any purpose, he has probably
    learned, from the price charged, that it is esteemed,
    even for such base purposes as firewood.</p>
<p>I am not, however, attempting to extol the American
    beech as a timber tree, but ask that it be given a
    place among the select ornamental nut-bearing kinds.
    And I think every farmer who has a pasture lot could
    afford a place for at least one beech tree, and if there is
    a low, moist spot in the field, or a stony corner, this
    will be a suitable place for such a tree; and the horses,
    cattle or sheep out in pasture during hot days in summer
    will be very grateful for the shade which a wide-spreading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> specimen will give them. It may be that
    the owner of said pasture may recall the lines of
    Garcilaso:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 20%"><span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;But in calm idlesse laid,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Supine in the cool shade</span><br />
    Of oak or ilex, beech or pendant pine,<br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sees his flocks feeding stray,</span><br />
    <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Whitening a length of way,</span><br />
    Or numbers up his homeward-tending kine.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p>He may be sure of one thing, and that is, the beech-nuts
    produced by one or many trees will always be acceptable
    to the children, and of these hungry mortals
    there is likely to be a few, at least, roaming about in
    ages to come, as in times past.</p>
<p>The beech is not really a desirable tree to plant on
    a lawn or near one's dwelling, because of its persistent
    foliage, which clings to the twigs very late in winter,
    and the rustling of the wind through the dry leaves is
    not soothing to one's nerves, although not quite as dismal
    as the moaning pines. In summer, and until late
    in autumn, the American beech is a noble and graceful
    tree,&mdash;and if I may be allowed the expression, one of
    the cleanest of trees; its large, thin, bright-green and
    glossy leaves retain none of the dust and cast-off material
    of other trees which may be floating through the
    air, but are ever bright and pure. The tree has naturally
    wide-spreading and somewhat drooping branches,
    and should be given plenty of room for development
    when planted for the nuts or as an ornamental tree. Its
    leaves and the small slender branchlets (Fig. 9) are eaten
    with avidity by all kinds of farm animals; consequently,
    protection may be required until the trees have reached
    a hight to be safe from such depredators.</p>
<p>Beech seedlings do not usually come into bearing in
    less than twenty to thirty years, but as no one in this
    country has ever attempted to cultivate this tree for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> nuts, or search our forests for precocious and superior
    varieties, we have to admit that the field remains unexplored,
    and as barren of results as it was when our ancestors
    first discovered
    America. Every hunter,
    woodman, farmer
    and botanist who has
    roamed through forests
    where the beech
    trees grow, is well
    aware of the fact that
    distinct varieties are
    not at all rare, some
    having nuts twice the
    size of others in the
    same woods or groves,
    and it is possible and
    probable that some
    nut culturist in the
    near future will find
    time to select these
    choice wild varieties
    for cultivation and
    propagation. It
    would not, in my opinion,
    be beneath the
    dignity of our national
    department of agriculture,
    or some of its
    numerous costly annexes,
    to occasionally
    take into consideration
    the natural products
    of this great
    country, and determine, by a series of experiments,
    whether or no they were not worthy of attention.</p>

<p><strong>Insects Injurious to the Beech.</strong>&mdash;No disease
    has, as yet, been known to seriously affect the beech,
    and as for insect enemies, it probably has a less number
    than any other denizen of our forests. It is true that
    transplanted trees, and those left exposed by cutting
    away protecting neighbors, are sometimes attacked by
    borers in the stem, branches and twigs, but these enemies
    naturally follow in the train of debility, it being
    one of the immutable economic laws of nature to hasten
    the demise and decomposition of the half-starved or
    otherwise enfeebled members of both the animal and
    vegetable kingdom.</p>
<p>Isolated beech trees growing by the roadsides in
    parks and fields are occasionally attacked by a large
    grayish, long-horn beetle, the <i>Goes pulverulenta</i>. It is
    about one inch long, and a rather sturdy beetle of a
    light grayish color, and usually infests the branches,
    but may occasionally attack the main stem. It is not
    abundant, and has seldom been found infesting the
    beech. There are also two or three borers of the Buprestis
    family of beetles which occasionally attack beech
    trees. They are distinguished by the broad heads and
    flattened bodies of the grubs, and they work just beneath
    the bark in the sapwood, causing dead patches, mainly
    on the south side of the stem and larger branches. If
    the dead bark is removed and the wounds painted they
    will soon heal over, unless the tree is suffering for moisture
    and nutrients at the roots. A few twig borers, with
    an occasional colony of caterpillars on the leaves, embody
    about all the insect enemies of the beech calling for any
    special attention, but there are a host of different species
    and kinds ever ready to pounce upon a sickly or dead
    tree, whether found in the field or forest.</p>
<p><strong>Properties and Uses.</strong>&mdash;The beechnut has been so
    long and favorably known that very little need be said
    here in regard to its properties and uses. In the forests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> it affords food for many kinds of birds, such as the wild
    turkey, partridge or grouse, and especially the pigeon,
    and immense flocks of these collect in the beech forests
    in autumn to feed upon the nuts. Deer are very fond
    of these nuts, and so are all of the squirrel family, and
    the little ground squirrel or chipmunk, <i>Tamias striatus</i>,
    of our Northern States, gives us a good practical lesson
    in the way of preserving the nuts over winter. These
    little rodents pack away the nuts in small pockets in
    their burrows and from two to three feet below the surface,
    where they are protected from excessive moisture
    and any considerable change of temperature. The chipmunk
    always stores the nuts in the ground, and not in
    hollow logs, as is sometimes asserted. The deer-mouse
    (<i>Hesperomys leucopus</i>), however, does select such places
    for putting away his winter's supply, but more frequently
    he chooses a hollow in the stem of some old tree,
    and several feet from the ground. Unlike the chipmunk,
    this mouse cleans the shells from the kernels,
    storing only the latter, and I have often found a quart
    or more when cutting down trees in winter. These kernels
    are usually so clean, bright, and free from odor,
    that it is to be feared the finder always confiscates them
    for his own use.</p>
<p>As the beechnut contains considerable oil, many
    schemes have been set on foot, in European countries,
    for its extraction and use as a salad oil. Early in the
    last century (1721) Aaron Hill, an English poet, proposed
    to pay off the national debt from the profits to be
    derived from the manufacture of beechnut oil; but his
    scheme fell through, like many others of its kind. It is
    also stated that Henry Fielding, so well known by his
    delightful stories of English society, once speculated
    rather largely on the manufacture of beechnut oil. In
    France, however, beechnut oil was formerly made in
    considerable quantities, and used in cooking fish and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> a salad oil. In Silesia it is used by the country people
    instead of butter, and the cakes which remain from the
    pressure are given to fatten swine, oxen and poultry.
    The forests of Eu and of Crécy, in the department of
    the Oise, it is stated by Duhamel du Monceau, have
    yielded, in a single season, more than 2,000,000 bushels
    of mast, but probably this referred to all kinds of nuts,
    and not beech-nuts alone. Years later, or in 1779,
    Michaux states that the forests of Compiègne, near the
    Verberie department of the Somme, afforded oil enough
    to supply the wants of the district for more than half a
    century. In some parts of France beech-nuts are roasted
    and served as a substitute for coffee. Many of these old
    forests have disappeared, but other kinds of nut trees
    are still being planted in France, and the product is
    simply enormous, and a source of wealth to the peasant,
    as well as the owners of extensive forests and orchards.</p>
<p>The beechnut has never been an article of commerce
    in this country, and it is rarely seen on sale in either
    country villages or our larger cities, not because of its
    scarcity or want of demand, but all that the country
    boys and girls find time to gather are wanted for their
    own pleasure and use. Picking up beech-nuts among
    the leaves in a forest, or even after raking off the leaves
    and then whipping the trees, is, at best, slow and rather
    tedious work, as I know full well from experience, and
    only once do I remember of having secured a rounded
    half bushel as the sum total of many raids on the beech
    trees in the neighborhood. But as the beechnut is the
    diamond among the larger and less precious gems of our
    forests, we should set a higher value upon it because
    small and rather difficult to obtain.</p>

<h3>CASTANOPSIS.</h3>
<p class="center">California chestnut. Western chinquapin. Evergreen
    chestnut.</p>
<p>Castanopsis, Spach. Name derived from <i>Castanea</i>,
    the chestnut. Order, <i>Cupuliferæ</i>. A genus of evergreen
    shrubs and trees, intermediate between the oaks
    (<i>Quercus</i>) and the chestnuts (<i>Castanea</i>). There are
    about a dozen species indigenous to Eastern Asia and
    the adjacent islands. Blume, in &quot;Flora Javae,&quot; Vol. II,
    1828-36, describes three species under <i>Castanea</i>, which
    he found in the mountains and more elevated regions of
    the Javanese islands. Very little, however, is known of
    these oriental evergreen chestnuts outside of the herbariums
    of professional botanists, and they are rarely referred
    to, even in standard botanical dictionaries, or
    dictionaries of gardening, and when mentioned they are
    usually placed in the genus <i>Castanea</i>. Edouard Spach,
    a half-century or more ago, gave a synopsis of the genus,
    for which he proposed the name of <i>Castanopsis</i>, and
    although not recognized by botanists in general for a
    number of years, it is now accepted by botanical authorities
    everywhere. We have but one indigenous species,
    and this on the Pacific coast, viz:</p>

<p><i>Castanopsis chrysophylla</i>, A. de Candolle. <i>Castanea
    chrysophylla</i>, Douglas. <i>Castanea sempervirens</i>,
    Kellogg.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Leaves coriaceous, evergreen, lanceolate or oblong,
        one to four inches long, acuminate or only acutish (Fig.
        10), cuneate at base and shortly petioled, entire green
        and glabrous above or somewhat scurfy, densely scurfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> beneath, with none or few yellow scales; male aments
        one to three inches long, densely pubescent; styles three,
        stout, glabrous, divergent; fruiting involucre with stout
        divergent spines (Fig. 11) one-half to one inch long,
        subverticillately many branched; nut usually solitary,
        obversely triangular, six lines long.&quot;&mdash;&quot;Geological Survey
        of California,&quot; Botany, Vol. II, p. 100.</p>
    <p>&quot;This handsome broad-leaved evergreen tree is indigenous
        to the elevated regions, from Monterey, California,
        northward to the Columbia river in Oregon. It is
        also common in the Sierra Nevadas at elevations of six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> thousand feet, but in its southern limits rarely below
        ten thousand feet elevation.&quot;&mdash;C. S. Sargent (&quot;Woods of
        the United States&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the warmer and drier regions of California it is
    a mere shrub two to six feet high, and these dwarf forms
    have, in some instances, been described as varieties.
    As, for instance, <i>Castanea chrysophylla</i>, var. <i>minor</i>,
    Bentham; <i>C. chrysophylla</i>, var. <i>minor</i>, A. de Candolle;
    and <i>C. chrysophylla</i>, var. <i>pumila</i>, Vasey. But northward,
    where the climate
    is more moist, it
    becomes a large tree
    fifty to one hundred
    and twenty feet high,
    with a stem two to
    three feet in diameter.
    In its wide variation
    in habit of growth,
    this western chinquapin
    is similar to our
    Eastern dwarf chestnut,
    which is mainly
    a low shrub in the
    more Southern States,
    but becomes a fair-sized tree in the Middle States, or
    near its northern limits.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;"> <img src="images/fig11.jpg" alt="" title="" height="391" width="350" /> <span class="caption"><span class="smcap"><a name="FIG._11" id="FIG._11">FIG. 11</a>. CASTANOPSIS BUR.</span></span> </div>
<p>I have introduced the Western chinquapin here
    among the nut-bearing trees, not with the idea that
    it will ever be extensively cultivated for its edible nuts,
    but because it is a beautiful broad-leaved evergreen tree,
    and of which we have far too few kinds in cultivation to
    give warmth and a cheerful aspect to our gardens and
    pleasure grounds in winter. It is true that, so far as
    can be learned at this time, no extended experiments
    have ever been made to introduce or cultivate the Castanopsis
    in the Atlantic States, consequently nothing positive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> is known as to whether it will succeed here or not.
    In its northernmost range it thrives in forests among
    many kinds of trees and shrubs that are already common
    in our gardens, and this leads me to think that specimens
    or seeds of this tree procured from the mountains
    of northern Oregon will withstand the rigors of our
    climate.</p>
<p>Mr. S. B. Parsons writes me that he first saw <i>Castanopsis
    chrysophylla</i> in Kew Gardens (Eng.) thirty-five
    years ago, and procured specimens, which were planted
    in his gardens at Flushing, N. Y., but they failed, presumably
    because not hardy. It may be that his specimens
    were raised from nuts procured in the warmer part
    of California, and, as with many other Pacific coast
    plants, proved to be tender, while later introductions of
    the same species collected in colder localities have proved
    hardy here. In my experience I have found a great difference
    in the hardiness of trees and plants obtained
    from the higher and lower levels of the mountains from
    Colorado westward to the Coast range, for in those regions
    acclimation extending over thousands of years has
    developed and fixed certain physiological attributes,
    which enables them to readily adapt themselves to similar
    conditions elsewhere, especially in the line of temperature.
    It may make no difference to those who want
    plants for warm climates, whether they are obtained
    from mountain or valley, but it certainly does to those
    who value hardiness above all other merits.</p>
<p>In horticultural matters we are supposed to confine
    ourselves within certain natural lines in making experiments,
    but if we fail in one, or one hundred, it proves
    little beyond the bare fact that we have not been successful.
    I have experimented enough to have become
    somewhat wary of deciding that a thing cannot be done,
    or is impossible, because of my own and others' failures.
    Every practical horticulturist can call to mind many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> productions which had evaded the pursuit of experimenters
    for decades and even centuries.</p>
<p>For specimens of the nuts, burs and plants of this
    handsome nut-bearing tree I am indebted to Mr. J. J.
    Harden, of Stayton, Oregon, who informs me that it
    grows in the mountains near by to a very large size, and
    among such well-known kinds of shrubs and trees as <i>Rhamnus Purshianus</i>, <i>Cornus Nuttalli</i>, <i>Corylus rostrata</i>,
    and various species of conifers which are now more or
    less common in our Eastern gardens and parks. The
    twigs and leaves are shown in Fig. 10, and below a nut,
    and in Fig. 11 a bur, all of natural size. The small conical
    nut is slightly triangular, with a rather firm, brittle
    shell, not fibrous as in the acorn and chestnut. The burs
    are produced singly, but sometimes several on a twig, and
    when mature, instead of opening by valves, as in the true
    chestnut, they break up irregularly. The kernels are
    sweet and excellent flavored, and are sought for by various
    kinds of birds, as well as by all the squirrel tribe, and
    for this reason it is very difficult to procure specimens,
    unless gathered before they are fully ripe. The nuts do
    not mature the first season, but pass the winter in a
    partly developed stage, usually ripening the second year
    about midsummer or, in northern Oregon, in July.</p>
<p>It is quite probable that this Castanopsis, when
    planted in the Atlantic States, will require a little shade
    or protection, like the American holly and similar broad-leaved
    evergreens, and while it may not thrive anywhere
    north of Delaware and Maryland, it is worth trying, as
    the sole native representative of a genus containing several
    species of noble evergreen trees.</p>

<h3>THE CHESTNUT.</h3>

<p>Castanea, <i>Tournefort</i>. The ancient classical name
    derived either from Castanis, a town in Thessaly, or one
    in Pontius, as historians disagree in regard to its derivation.
    The genus belongs to the order <i>Cupuliferæ</i>.</p>
<p>Male flowers irregularly clustered in long, naked,
    cylindrical catkins from the axils of the leaves and on
    the new shoots of the season. Calyx five or six parted;
    stamens or pollen-bearing organs seven to fifteen; anther
    two-celled. On old, mature trees, the male catkins
    are usually crowded near the end of the short new twigs,
    as shown in Fig. 12, the terminal one productive; but
    on young thrifty trees, wide apart. Female flowers
    always on and near the base of a late-developed male
    catkin, sometimes two or three together,&mdash;or even six or
    eight on the chinquapins,&mdash;oval or ovoid, scaly, prickly,
    two- to four-valved involucre or bur; calyx usually with
    a four- to six-lobed border crowning the three- to seven-celled
    ovary; stigmas bristle-shaped, and as many in
    number as there are cells in the ovary. Shell of the nut
    leathery, not brittle, ovoid, two or more together in the
    larger species, in others solitary, or only one in a bur.
    Kernel very thick, fleshy, and somewhat plaited, sweet
    and edible.</p>
<p>Both male and female flowers appear late in spring,
    the males usually exceedingly so, exhaling a slightly nauseating
    odor. The productive male catkins appear the
    latest, their base becoming the rachis or stalk supporting
    the burs, this rather anomalous arrangement appearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> to be a natural provision to secure fertilization in
    case the earlier catkins failed.</p>
<p>The genus <i>Castanea</i>, as now restricted, contains
    shrubs and large trees, with simple, alternate deciduous
    leaves, coarsely serrate, with pointed spiny teeth. Indigenous,
    and widely distributed over northern Africa,
    southern Europe, Asia and the eastern half of the
    United States.</p>
<p>The common English name of this nut is supposed
    to be derived from the Anglo-Saxon <i>cystel</i>, chestnut,
    and <i>cyst-beam</i> or <i>cisten-beam</i>, chestnut tree; Old English, <i>chastein</i> or <i>chesten</i>; Old German, <i>chestinna</i> or <i>kestinna</i>; Modern German, <i>kestene</i> or <i>kastanie</i>; French, <i>castaigne</i> or <i>chataigne</i>; Provencal, <i>castanha</i>; Spanish, <i>castana</i>; Italian, <i>castagna</i>, from the Latin <i>castanea</i>.</p>
<p><strong>History of the Chestnut.</strong>&mdash;The so-called European
    chestnut is supposed to be indigenous to Asia
    Minor, Armenia, Caucasus and northern Africa, and
    from these countries it was introduced and became naturalized
    throughout the greater part of temperate Europe,
    where it has been cultivated from time immemorial.
    The Romans are supposed to have distributed it
    northward through France and Great Britain, and in
    the latter country there were trees centuries ago of such
    large size that many of the early English authors claimed
    this tree was indigenous. But in the absence of any
    natural forests of chestnut, the claim had to be abandoned.
    In parts of France, Italy and Spain, the chestnut
    has become thoroughly naturalized and, as we may
    say, run wild, but as one of the early investigators says,
    in speaking of the abundance of old chestnut trees on
    the Apennines, they are generally scattered over the
    surface like trees on a well-arranged lawn, and not
    crowded and massed, as they would be in a state of
    nature or in a forest. On the south side of the Alps the
    trees grow up to an altitude of twenty-five hundred feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> and on the Pyrenees some two or three hundred feet
    higher.</p>
<p>There are old trees of immense size almost everywhere
    in the milder regions of Europe, and the celebrated
    monarchs of Etna have been many times described
    by travelers. The largest measure one hundred
    and eighty feet in circumference near the root. All the
    early Roman writers who have anything to say about
    rural affairs, mention the chestnut as one of their valuable
    trees, producing nuts used for various purposes.
    Pliny enumerates eight varieties, but Columella appears
    to place more value upon the timber, especially the
    sprouts, for stakes, than he does on the nuts. But long
    before the Romans began to cultivate the chestnut, the
    Greeks held it in high esteem under the name of <i>Sardianos
    Balanos</i> or Sardis nut, and still later it was called <i>Dios Balanos Lopimon</i>.</p>
<p>The European chestnut has been so frequently and
    extensively referred to by ancient and modern authors
    that it would not be at all difficult to fill a large volume
    with brief extracts from their works, but my aim is not
    so much to show what has been done with this nut in
    other countries as what we may do with it here. All
    nations who have any experience with it admit its value
    as food for many wild and domesticated animals, as well
    as for the human race, and we know, from our long
    experience with the native species, that it is highly
    esteemed wherever known, although it must be admitted
    that our sparse population and the abundance of
    other kinds of food, have tended to make us careless
    and neglectful of the indigenous chestnut.</p>
<p>It may be well, before dismissing this brief history
    of the chestnut, to add that while nearly all the ancient
    authors, in referring to it, employed its present scientific
    name of <i>Castanea</i>, still, when botanists first attempted
    what has since been recognized as the scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> classification of plants, many of them placed the chestnut
    in the same genus as the beech, retaining the generic
    name of <i>Fagus</i> for both.</p>
<p>Linnæus, in his <i>Systema Naturæ</i>, 1766, Vol. II,
    p. 630, describes two species of the chestnut and one of
    beech in the genus <i>Fagus</i>, although Tournefort, in his
    &quot;History of Plants Growing About Paris,&quot; published
    seventy years before that of Linnæus, had recognized
    the distinctive characteristics of these two groups of nut
    trees, and he adopted the present name of <i>Castanea</i> for
    the generic name of the chestnut, and <i>Fagus</i> for that of
    the beech. But nearly all of the English and earlier
    American botanists adopted and followed Linnæus in
    his classification, ignoring the works of the earlier as
    well as contemporaneous continental botanists. I merely
    refer to this matter of botanical nomenclature because
    some of my readers may have occasion to consult the
    earlier authors who describe American plants, as, for
    instance, such works as John Clayton's &quot;Flora of Virginia,&quot;
    1739, Thomas Walter's &quot;Flora Caroliniana,&quot;
    1787, or Humphrey Marshall's &quot;American Grove,&quot; 1785.
    In all of these, and others, the chestnut is described as a
    species of beech (<i>Fagus</i>).</p>
<p><strong>Propagation of the Chestnut.</strong>&mdash;The usual mode
    of propagating the chestnut is from seed, when trees are
    wanted for general planting or for stocks upon which
    to graft improved and rare varieties. Under some conditions
    and circumstances, it is best to plant the nuts
    soon after they are ripe in autumn, and this appears to
    be the most natural method; in fact, it is the way in
    which forests have been produced and are constantly
    renewed and perpetuated, when man does not interfere
    to prevent it. But nature is in no hurry in such matters,
    while man always is, because his time is limited;
    consequently, in our attempts at the multiplication and
    cultivation of plants we aim to save both time and material,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> therefore cannot afford to adopt nature's slow and
    wasteful processes.</p>
<p>The principal objection to planting chestnuts in the
    fall is the danger of having them destroyed by vermin,
    which abound almost everywhere. There is also danger
    of the nuts sprouting prematurely in the autumn, and of
    the young growth being killed by cold or by excessive
    moisture during late fall rains. But these natural enemies
    and obstacles prevent an excess in number and the
    overcrowding of trees in our forests. It is, no doubt,
    possible and practicable to smear the nuts with poisonous
    substances, or those sufficiently offensive to prevent
    the depredations of vermin, but taking all things into
    consideration, I am decidedly in favor of preserving the
    nuts in bulk and in a dormant state until the season
    arrives for insuring a rapid and continuous growth, and
    then planting them. To do this in our cold northern
    climate, as well as in the South, requires more care and
    attention with chestnuts than with the harder-shelled
    kinds, like the walnut and hickory nut. As a rule, it
    may be said that all the hardy kinds of nuts sprout at a
    rather low temperature and a few degrees above the
    freezing point, and for this reason it is well to select as
    cool a spot in the open ground as possible for their winter
    quarters, and then examine them as early as can be done
    conveniently in the spring.</p>
<p>In this matter of manipulating and preserving
    chestnuts for planting, as well as what follows in regard
    to transplanting, pruning and grafting, I shall give my
    own practice, with results; and while it may differ from
    that of other propagators, it is one evolved from long
    experience, many successes, and a few failures.</p>
<p><strong>Gathering and Assorting Nuts.</strong>&mdash;When the
    nuts begin to ripen and fall, gather as soon as possible,
    and if the trees are on your own grounds and will admit
    of such an operation, thrash them and secure the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> crop at once. The object of this early gathering is to
    collect the false and weevil-infested specimens and destroy
    them. But in whatever way the nuts are collected,
    they should be stored in the shade and in shallow boxes,
    or spread out on a tight floor; but the better way would
    be on screens over a floor, and then when the grubs
    worked their way downward through the nuts and screen,
    they would fall upon the floor, from which they could
    be taken up and burned or otherwise destroyed. The
    nuts, while on the screen or other receptacle, should be
    stirred over daily for two or three weeks, and by that
    time they will be in good condition for either planting
    or packing away for the winter. But before finally disposing
    of the nuts in either way, they should be carefully
    looked over, and every shrunken specimen, as well as all
    with punctured shells from which the grubs have escaped,
    removed from among the sound stock, because
    these damaged nuts are not only useless, but are very
    likely to decay and affect all with which they come in
    contact. It is not to be expected that by such means or
    handling we can get rid of all the grubs enclosed in the
    nuts when gathered, for there will always be a few not
    more than half grown at the time, and these will remain
    hidden in the nuts until midwinter, or later, but the
    greater part of the brood will reach maturity within two
    or three weeks after the nuts are ripe. Of course, what
    is said here about chestnut weevils is only applicable to
    chestnuts grown in this country, but all species and varieties,
    when planted here, are subject to the attacks of
    this pest&mdash;at least, everywhere in the Eastern and
    Southern States.</p>
<p>Having assorted the nuts carefully, the sound ones
    should be reserved for planting; these should be mixed
    with or stratified with moist, sharp sand, and stored in
    boxes of convenient size for handling and examination,
    whenever this is required. In preparing the boxes, bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> a number of small holes through the bottom, and over
    each of these lay a piece of a broken flower-pot, brick
    or stone, then cover the bottom one inch deep with the
    moist sand, and on this place a single layer of nuts, then
    fill in all interstices with sand, and also use enough more
    to fairly cover the layer; and proceed in this way until
    all the nuts are disposed of or the box is full, covering
    the top layer one or two inches deep, because the sand
    will settle some after the work seems complete. The
    boxes may be covered with fine wire netting or with narrow
    strips of boards, fitting these so that mice cannot
    get in, but should not be air-tight. They may then be
    buried in the open ground, selecting some knoll or dry
    spot for this purpose, for the nuts should not be placed
    where they will be submerged, or even be water-soaked,
    at any time during the fall, winter or early spring. If
    no such spot is conveniently near, then set the boxes on
    the top of the ground, and on the north side of some
    building or in the shade of an evergreen tree, and bank
    over with soil, covering the boxes a foot deep. If the
    spot selected is under the eaves of a building, place
    boards over the heap of soil, to carry off the water, for
    the object is to keep the nuts moderately moist, cool,
    and where they will not be subjected to frequent changes
    of temperature. In our Northern States the nuts,
    under such conditions, usually become frozen during
    the coldest weather, but this does not injure them if the
    sand is moist and they remain frozen, as there will be no
    danger of germination; while if kept too warm, they
    may start to grow before the seedbed is ready, in spring,
    for their reception. I have tried keeping the nuts
    mixed with sand in a cool cellar, also in outbuildings,
    but have not found any other place so certain as pits in
    the open ground.</p>
<p><strong>Seedbed and Soil.</strong>&mdash;It is well to have the seedbed
    prepared the previous autumn, but it is not absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> necessary. The soil for the bed should be light, either
    sandy or loamy, and if not rich, made so by adding very
    old and fine stable manure, or leaf mold from the forest&mdash;I
    prefer the latter, as it is the most natural for all
    kinds of seedling nut trees. Whatever fertilizing materials
    are used, they should be placed on or near the surface,
    and never worked in deeply, for our aim should be
    the production of side or lateral fibers, and not coarse
    perpendicular roots. Furthermore, seedling nut trees
    grown on light, sandy soils or in pure leaf mold, produce
    a far greater number of small fibrous roots than on heavy
    soils, and this is a decided advantage with those which
    are to be transplanted.</p>
<p><strong>Planting the Nuts.</strong>&mdash;When the time arrives for
    planting, take the nuts from their winter quarters, and
    after sifting out the sand, sow or drop them in drills,
    covering about two inches deep with fine soil. With
    the small native varieties my practice has been to sow in
    wide drills; that is, those made with the blade of a
    common garden hoe, and of the same width, the nuts
    being scattered along the bottom two to three inches
    apart.</p>
<p>The soil is then drawn in over them and pressed
    down with the back of the hoe, or by passing a light
    garden roller over the surface. If the size of the seedbed
    is not limited, or only a small quantity of nuts are
    to be sown, then the single row would be preferable,
    because less hand weeding will be needed to subdue the
    weeds, and for all the larger varieties I should certainly
    recommend it, because they are of a more stocky growth.
    The distance allowed between the drills will depend
    somewhat upon the implements to be employed in cultivation,
    as well as how long the seedlings are to remain
    in the seedbed before transplanting, but from two to
    three feet will be found convenient for the ordinary
    modes of cultivation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>If the seedlings make a fair average growth the first
    season they will be from one to three feet high in the
    autumn, and as soon as the leaves have fallen they may
    be taken up, or allowed to remain until the following
    spring and then lifted. But if, from any cause, they
    have made a feeble growth, it is better to let them remain
    in the seedbed another year. Where large quantities
    of seedlings are raised they are usually taken up
    with a tree-digger drawn by a span of horses or mules,
    but with only a few hundred or a thousand to dig, a
    common spade will answer every purpose; and if, when
    removed from the seedbed, they are found to have produced
    long perpendicular taproots, these should be
    shortened to about one-half their original length. For
    instance, if these taproots are taken up entire and are
    eighteen to twenty inches long, cut away the lower half,
    whether it consists of one or more long perpendicular
    roots, as this pruning will force the plants to produce a
    greater number of lateral roots, and it is upon these we
    depend mainly for keeping our trees alive and vigorous
    if transplanted when larger and older. All side branches
    should be pruned off close to the main stem, for we aim
    to favor the latter in its growth upward until it reaches
    the required hight for either grafting or forming the
    future head of the tree.</p>
<p>In taking up seedlings, it is not safe to leave them
    for any considerable time exposed to the sun and drying
    winds, and they should be carried either to a shed or
    other building while being pruned, and also covered
    with blankets in the field, except during moist, cloudy
    days. A very little drying of the small fibers on such
    plants is always more or less injurious.</p>
<p><strong>Planting in Nursery Rows.</strong>&mdash;After the seedlings
    have been taken from the seedbed and pruned, they
    should be set out in nursery rows, four feet apart, and
    the plants about eighteen inches in the row. Trenches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> should be opened for the reception of the plants, and
    wide enough to allow all the roots to be spread out in a
    natural position; and it is well to set a little deeper than
    the seedlings were in the seedbed, because newly plowed
    ground will settle some after the planting is finished,
    although the soil should always be packed firmly about
    the stems of newly set trees, whether large or small.
    The more frequent and thorough the cultivation during
    the ensuing summer, the more rapid will be the growth
    of the trees.</p>
<p>If the transplanted seedlings have produced any
    considerable number of side branches,&mdash;and especially,
    low down,&mdash;these may be pruned off at any time during
    the summer, for our object is usually to secure straight,
    upright stems for grafting the following spring, if they
    are large and tall enough; if not, we may delay this operation
    for another year. Of course, small chestnut stocks
    may be grafted close to the ground, but there is nothing
    really gained by this, for a good strong stock will push
    a cion forward more in one season than a weak stock in
    two or three seasons. But when the stocks have reached
    a diameter of from three-eighths to one-half an inch
    three or four feet from the ground, they may be grafted,
    but I would prefer to have them a little over than under
    these sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Stocks From the Forests.</strong>&mdash;It is not necessary
    for a man who may need a few chestnut stocks for experimental
    or other purposes, to wait until they can be
    grown from the nut, because these can always be purchased
    at the nurseries; but if one does not wish to
    incur even this small outlay, it may be avoided by obtaining
    a supply from the forests, provided there are
    any in the neighborhood where chestnut seedlings are to
    be found, and the owner will permit their removal. The
    best wild stocks are usually to be found in recent clearings,
    or where the larger trees have been cut off for timber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> and the underbrush, composed of seedlings and
    sprouts, is left to grow up again into a forest. There
    are many thousands of acres in New Jersey, New York,
    and other Eastern States, from which the timber is cut
    every twenty or thirty years, and no further attention
    paid to the land or what it produces. Wherever such
    clearings are found containing chestnut trees, good
    stocks can usually be procured by selecting those varying
    from one to two inches in diameter at the ground, and
    if the soil in which they are growing is rather poor and
    stony they will usually have pretty good roots, if carefully
    taken up. They should be pruned to a single
    stem, and this cut off at a hight of from five to six feet
    or less, then planted where they are to remain permanently.
    Such stocks, if carefully taken up and planted,
    will throw out numerous sprouts from their stems during
    the summer, but all should be rubbed off while small
    and tender, except three or four at the top, and the following
    spring, if wanted for this purpose, they may be
    grafted in the same way as the young stocks growing in
    the nursery, thereby saving three or four years of time
    in securing bearing trees. Having often employed such
    wildings for stocks with just as good results as with
    those raised from the nuts in nursery rows, I am inclined
    to recommend them, where obtainable, knowing that
    there are thousands of farmers and owners of small
    places in the country who can do likewise, but may have
    never thought it practicable to transplant nut trees from
    the forest, although well aware of the fact that elms,
    maples, and similar kinds were obtained there, and in
    immense numbers, for planting in the streets of villages
    and alongside country highways.</p>
<p><strong>The Season for Grafting.</strong>&mdash;The proper time for
    grafting the chestnut is in early spring, just as the buds
    begin to swell, but not until all danger of freezing
    weather is past, although light frosts will not seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> injure newly set cions. The grafting may be continued
    while the leaves are unfolding, provided the cions were
    cut early and stored in a cool place, where they remain
    in a dormant state until used. I usually cut the shoots
    wanted for this purpose during the late fall or winter,
    and then pack them away in a cool cellar between layers
    of damp moss (<i>sphagnum</i>) to be obtained in almost any
    swamp. Cions may be taken from the tree on the same
    day that they are used, but there is some risk in this,
    because we cannot control the weather, and a week of
    warm rain in spring may delay us in grafting, while it is
    pushing our stocks into leaf; and then, our dormant
    cions are available, while those on the trees are not, owing
    to their expanded and tender buds.</p>
<p>The shoots used for cions are those of the previous
    season's growth, or as usually termed, one-year-old
    wood; and in selecting these, endeavor to get such as
    are plump, well ripened and firm. If taken from young
    and very thrifty chestnut trees, there is likely to be a
    considerable portion of the upper end of the shoot that
    is rather soft, spongy and immature, and this should be
    discarded, as it would be a waste of time to use it. Of
    course, I am supposing that the grafter is so fortunate
    as to be able to make his own selection of the wood desired;
    if not, then he may be compelled to do the best
    he can with that obtained elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Grafting Materials.</strong>&mdash;The really essential materials
    and implements required in grafting nut trees are
    few in number. Grafting wax must be provided, and
    while there are many different compositions used for
    this purpose, I much prefer, for ordinary work in the
    open air, a wax made after the old formula, and as follows:
    Take one pound of common rosin, one-half pound
    of beeswax, and one-quarter of a pound of beef tallow;
    melt together and stir enough to insure the thorough
    intermingling of the ingredients, and then set away to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> cool, or pour into cold water and work up into cakes or
    rolls and wrap in paper until wanted for use. Larger
    quantities may be made if required, preserving the same
    proportions of the materials used. If to be used immediately
    in grafting chestnuts and similar trees, then procure
    some sheets of tough Manilla paper of only moderate
    thickness, and cut this up into sheets about six
    inches wide and a foot long. While the fresh-made
    wax is melted, take an old and rather stiff paint brush,
    dip it into the hot wax and coat the papers thinly
    with it, and then spread them out on shelves or elsewhere
    to cool, and let them remain undisturbed until
    wanted for use. Any thin kind of cloth may be used
    instead of paper, but I prefer the latter because it will
    yield to the pressure of the enlarging stock and cion
    when growth begins, and it will not be necessary to examine
    the grafted stock so frequently during the summer
    to prevent girdling, as is usually the case when a
    tougher material is employed for wrappers. Before these
    waxed sheets are taken into the field for use, lay each
    one separately on a piece of board with the waxed side
    up, and with the point of a sharp knife cut them crossways
    into narrow strips of from one-half to three-fourths
    of an inch wide. But for convenience in handling,
    insert the point of the knife a half-inch from one edge,
    but cut the other clean through, so that the whole sheet
    of strips can be lifted together.</p>
<p>In early spring there is usually more or less windy
    weather, and if waxed sheets of paper are taken out into
    the field unprotected they are very likely to become tangled
    up and useless. To prevent this, procure a number
    of large but very shallow paper boxes, such as can usually
    be had at the stores and groceries of almost any village,
    and in these place a single layer of the cut waxed
    sheets, where they will be protected from wind and dust
    until removed for immediate use.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>Other kinds of grafting wax can, of course, be used,
    and are usually procurable at the seed stores or made at
    home, and I have given their composition and the formulas
    for their manufacture in my work, &quot;The Propagation
    of Plants;&quot; but, as I have already said, this old standard
    kind of wax is just as good as any other, although a little
    more troublesome to use on account of its sticky consistency.
    Raffia or bass may be employed as ligatures for
    holding the cions in place, then covered with Leport's
    or other kinds of liquid grafting wax; but when these
    are employed it will be necessary to examine the grafted
    trees frequently, in order to cut the ligatures to prevent
    girdling.</p>
<p>The best implement for grafting is a common broad-blade
    pocket knife. One with a blade three to three
    and a half inches long and three-fourths of an inch wide,
    is a handy size. It should be of the best material for
    grafting chestnuts, because the wood of this tree is
    coarse-grained, and so filled with siliceous matter that it
    soon dulls the keenest blade, and the grafter will, of
    necessity, have to use his whetstone frequently. In
    grinding the knife-blade have the sides a true level, from
    the back to the edge, especially the underside when to be
    held in the right hand with the edge towards the body.
    The importance of having a blade of this form will soon
    become apparent when the grafter attempts to make a
    true sloping cut on either stock or cion, and it would be
    well for the novice to practice for an hour or two in
    splicing some worthless twigs before commencing upon
    more valuable material, for even an expert workman is
    very likely to make some awkward dissections and joints
    when out of practice. The professional propagator of
    plants may think such details are unimportant, but I
    wish to impress upon the amateur that in grafting nut
    trees we are dealing with kinds that will not respond
    satisfactorily to such free manipulations as the apple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> and pear; consequently, better and more careful handling
    is required to insure success.</p>
<p>When ready to begin operations in the field, take
    out a quantity of the shoots to be used for cions, and
    keep them wrapped in damp cloth or
    packed in a box, basket or other receptacle
    with wet moss, to prevent drying.
    If any considerable number of stocks are
    to be grafted, then an assistant or two
    will be required, for the grafter cannot
    be alternately handling the
    knife and cions and wax, and
    do good work, but if he only
    inserts the cions and his assistant
    applies the waxed ligatures,
    the operation will proceed
    more rapidly and satisfactorily.</p>

    GRAFT INSERTED.</span></span> </div>
<p><strong>Modes of Grafting.</strong>&mdash;The
    only two modes of grafting
    that I shall recommend
    for the chestnut are the splice
    or whip graft, and the cleft
    or wedge graft. In the splice
    graft, the cion and stock
    should be of about the same
    diameter, but if there is any
    difference let it be in favor of
    the stock, and this the largest. In this
    mode of grafting, the stock is cut off with
    an upward slope, exposing two or three
    inches of wood; and about midway on
    this slope a small cleft or incision is made, forming
    what is called a &quot;tongue.&quot; The cion is then cut in the
    same way from the upper end downward, with a corresponding
    incision, as seen in Fig. 13. Then the two are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> neatly fitted together, the tongue on one entering the cleft
    on the other, making a close joint, as shown in Fig. 14.
    The bark of the cion and stock should be exactly even on
    one side at least; and if they are of the same size, so
    much the better, for then they will be even on both sides;
    but we cannot expect to secure such perfect joints on
    every stock, or any considerable number, although we
    aim to do so as frequently as possible. When the cion
    is fitted, the waxed paper is applied by placing one end
    of the strip at or near the base of the splice, then wind
    it spirally and firmly upward until the entire wound is
    covered. If one of the waxed strips is not enough use
    another, for it will do no harm if they are double on a
    part or all over the joint. The cion should not be much
    over four inches long, and a less length is preferable,
    but not so convenient for handling. One good prominent
    bud on each cion is sufficient, and this left near
    the upper end, but on short-jointed wood we may use
    cions with two or more buds without greatly increasing
    their length. After the cion is in place and every part
    of the splice is carefully sealed with the waxed paper,
    place a small piece or a little wax on the upper end of
    the cion, just enough to cover the exposed wound and
    prevent evaporation of the natural moisture or sap in
    the wood. I have found, in practice, that this sealing
    the end of the cion is time well spent; in fact, to leave
    any of the wood cells exposed to the air endangers the
    success of the operation.</p>
<p>Young shoots from a quarter of an inch in diameter
    up to five-eighths may be used for cions, in splice
    grafting; and with a little care in the selection of stocks,
    or by cutting them off a few inches higher or lower, we
    may readily manage to have them nearly of the same
    diameter to match our cions, whether they are large or
    small, and such unions will soon heal over, leaving no
    scar at the point where the two have been joined.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>If the new growth or shoot to be employed as a cion
    is slender and feeble, then the base of the cion may be of
    two-year-old wood, leaving just a bud or two on the
    upper end of the one-year shoot. But it will seldom be
    necessary to employ such cions in grafting the chestnut,
    although it may occur when seeking to secure wood for
    propagation, from very old trees which have made only
    a feeble annual growth.</p>

<p><strong>Cleft Grafting.</strong>&mdash;This method is employed principally
    upon stocks or branches of trees too large for splicing.
    The stock is first cut off at the
    point where it is desirable to insert the
    cion; then split with a knife, being
    careful to divide it, so that the edges
    will be kept smooth, and not rough
    and ragged (Fig. 15). When the knife
    blade is withdrawn, the cleft may be
    kept open with a hard wood wedge,
    if the stock is too large to admit of
    opening it with the point of the knife
    when ready to insert the cion. The cion may be three
    or four inches long, containing two or more buds; the
    lower end is cut wedge-shape, as shown in Fig. 16, and
    slightly the thickest on the side to be set
    against the bark of the stock. In stocks
    of an inch or more in diameter, two cions,
    one on each side, may be inserted (Fig.
    17), and if both grow one should be cut
    away, else the tree, in later years, will be
    very likely to divide or break apart at this
    point. In stocks of an inch or less in diameter,
    one cion is sufficient, the top of
    the stock to be cut off with an upward
    slope, as shown in Fig. 18. After the cions are inserted,
    the entire exposed surface of the wood must be covered
    with grafting wax or waxed paper, and usually both may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> be employed with benefit. All the various forms of
    grafting in the open air, as described in my work on the
    &quot;Propagation of Plants,&quot; may be employed on the
    chestnut, but the two here given will probably answer
    just as well as others for those who may have occasion to
    propagate this tree.</p>
<p><strong>Success in Grafting.</strong>&mdash;The question has been
    asked many times, and will, no doubt, be frequently
    repeated, &quot;What percentage of cions should one accustomed
    to grafting make grow?&quot; As there are no statistics
    upon which to base an answer to the question, I can
    only give my own personal experience, and this leads me
    to say that seventy-five per cent may be considered an
    excellent, if not a high average. In some seasons this
    has been exceeded by at least ten per cent, while in
    others it has fallen as much or more below, with no
    apparent reason for the difference. Ninety-five per cent
    of the cions may push their buds, or even make a growth
    of several inches, then begin to die off; consequently,
    the time to count your successfully grafted trees is in
    the autumn, and not in spring or midsummer, as it is to
    be feared some are in the habit of doing when making a
    report upon what they call success in grafting nut trees.</p>
<p><strong>Growth of Cions.</strong>&mdash;Cions set in strong stocks
    usually make a very rapid and vigorous growth, and if
    left unchecked, there is danger of loss by being broken
    or blown off by strong winds during the summer and
    autumn. To prevent this as much as possible, it has
    been my practice to pinch off the ends of the young
    shoots when they are about two feet long. Lateral
    shoots will then push out freely, and in some seasons it
    may be necessary to check their growth in the same way
    later. On feeble stocks, or those quite small, and with
    the less vigorous growing varieties, no summer pinching
    or pruning will be required. My experimental grounds
    are well protected upon the north and west, not only by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> rising ground, but by Norway spruce and American
    arbor vitæ hedges twice as high as the grafted chestnut
    trees in the nursery rows, and yet almost every season
    some of the stronger-growing grafts are blown out or
    broken off by the wind. After the first season there is
    little danger of injury, probably because the union between
    cion and stock has become stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Grafting Chestnut Sprouts.</strong>&mdash;In grafting the
    vigorous sprouts that always spring up from the stumps
    of old trees that have been recently cut down, we may
    reasonably expect a prodigious growth of the cion the
    first season, as well as in succeeding ones, and if all goes
    well with them we will secure large bearing trees in a
    very few years, but such stocks are only available where
    old trees are sacrificed for their timber or other purposes.
    Having a few such sprouts on my place, they have been
    utilized from time to time in testing some of the newer
    varieties. In one instance I allowed the cion, set on a
    sprout about one inch in diameter, six feet from the
    base, to grow unchecked throughout the season, as it
    was in a protected position, and in the fall the entire
    length of the main stem and lateral branches was sixty-five
    feet, and all from one bud on a cion set early in the
    spring. The third year this tree bore about a peck of
    very large nuts, to which I shall have occasion to refer
    again under &quot;Injurious Insects.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grafting Large Trees.</strong>&mdash;Grafting large chestnut
    trees with stems of six inches or more in diameter, and
    with large spreading heads, is possible, but far from
    being economical or practicable, especially if the trees
    stand out where they will get the full sweep of prevailing
    winds. By cutting off and grafting a few of the
    branches at a time for several seasons in succession, one
    may, in a few years, succeed in getting the entire head
    grafted, but there is constant danger of some of the cions
    being broken out if they make a vigorous growth, leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> a distorted and ill-shapen tree. Having experimented
    somewhat in this line with variable success, I
    am not inclined to recommend it, because ten trees can
    be raised to a bearing age on moderate-sized stocks with
    less labor, and the results will be more satisfactory.</p>
<p><strong>Budding Chestnuts.</strong>&mdash;I have frequently tried
    budding chestnut stocks as described for the almond,
    and extensively employed with other kinds of fruit trees.
    But the results of my experiments have been unsatisfactory,
    although buds were set from very early in summer
    until late in the fall, also on young and old wood; but
    so few have taken and remained alive over winter that
    my personal experience in this mode of propagation will
    not justify its recommendation to others. Perhaps there
    is some secret connected with the operation that I have
    not yet discovered, but which is known to other propagators.
    Of course, budding with semi-dormant wood and
    buds in spring, as soon as the bark will peel from the wood,
    is practicable, but there is really nothing to be gained
    by this mode of propagation over that of grafting.</p>
<p><strong>Transplanting and Pruning.</strong>&mdash;There is no tree
    that will bear or withstand more severe pruning than
    the chestnut. If trees of one or five hundred years of
    age are cut down, the stumps are sure to throw up an
    immense number of sprouts from adventitious buds, as
    these are readily produced at almost any point on the
    sapwood or alburnum under the bark; and yet, with this
    inherent vitality and faculty of recuperation, the chestnut
    tree does not naturally, like many other deciduous
    kinds, throw up suckers from the roots. Keeping this
    peculiarity in mind, the cultivator has only to use his
    pruning knife freely upon the trees to secure almost any
    form desired. But after the trees have become well
    established, very little pruning will be required, except
    to occasionally thin out or remove a rambling branch, to
    secure a well-balanced and shapely head to the tree.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>In transplanting from the nursery rows, after grafting,
    and especially if the trees are of some considerable
    size and large enough to set where they are to remain
    permanently, there is sure to be a loss of roots, and
    those that are preserved are likely to remain for a short
    time inactive and incapable of absorbing nutrients from
    the soil to which they are transferred, or until new rootlets
    are produced. Under these conditions we aim to
    favor the roots by removing or cutting back the greater
    part of the branches. No matter how carefully such
    trees are lifted and their roots protected during the
    operation of transplanting, it will check the growth,
    and the best and most practical restorative is severe
    pruning of the top, and every young shoot of the previous
    season's growth should be cut back to within three
    or four inches of its base. I am presuming that the
    trees have been grafted only one year, but if older, and
    the cions were set high enough to begin the formation of
    the head of the tree, then the entire young growth may
    be cut away and some of the older wood, but of course
    not below the graft. All broken roots must be cut off;
    and the ends of the larger ones, roughly severed with
    the spade or other implements employed in digging,
    should have their wounds smoothed with a sharp knife.</p>
<p>Frequent transplanting and root-pruning young
    nursery stock tends to keep up a proper root system,
    and an abundance of small fibrous roots near the main
    stem, and trees so treated are worth much more, if to be
    transplanted later, than those left undisturbed; but
    while the latter may be twice the size of the former
    when of the same age, they are not worth half as much
    to the purchaser, or for transplanting in our own
    grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Staking Transplanted Trees.</strong>&mdash;This is always
    necessary for recently planted trees, if they are of any
    considerable size, or from six feet high and upwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> If not supported by stakes they are sure to be swayed
    about, if not thrown over, by strong winds in summer.
    A strong stake, two or three inches in diameter, would
    better be set at the time of planting the tree, thereby
    avoiding breaking off or crushing the roots, as frequently
    happens when stakes are driven down among them later
    in the season. Set the stakes or drive into the subsoil
    six inches from the stem, then use strips of cloth, sacks,
    carpet, or some similar material, for tying, because hard
    cord or twine will be very likely to cut through the tender
    bark from the constant swaying about of the stems.
    Wind the strips around the stem, and then cross between
    it and the stake once or twice, to prevent the tree from
    pressing against or coming in contact with the stake.
    Renew the stakes and tying materials, if necessary, until
    the trees become firmly established, and provided with
    lateral roots large enough to keep them in an upright
    position.</p>
<p><strong>Mulching.</strong>&mdash;Placing a few forkfuls of coarse stable
    manure, half-rotted straw, leaves, or any similar material,
    on the surface about the stems of recently planted
    trees, will prove very beneficial, in not only keeping
    down the weeds, but aiding greatly in retaining moisture
    in the soil about the roots. The application of
    some such material as a mulch is all the more important
    with the chestnut, because these trees are always to be
    planted in a naturally dry and well drained soil.</p>
<p><strong>Distance Between Trees.</strong>&mdash;How far apart chestnut
    trees should be planted will depend very much upon
    the species and varieties, some growing to immense
    trees, while others are only fair-sized shrubs at maturity.
    But for the larger-growing varieties, forty to fifty feet
    between the trees is none too much space, when planted
    for their nuts and not for timber. If set in a single row
    along the public highways, farm lanes or around the
    outbuildings, to serve as shade or ornament, and for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> nuts, then about forty feet will answer very well for the
    larger-growing species; and I will add that, in my opinion,
    all the larger kinds of nut trees will give better
    returns if placed in such positions, than when set in
    orchards or in compact masses. When set in single
    rows or widely scattered, they are less liable to be attacked
    by insects and diseases, while they will still serve
    the double purpose of being both ornamental and useful.
    I must admit, however, that in my experimental grounds
    the trees are planted only twenty feet apart, but with
    the expectation of soon cutting out every alternate
    specimen.</p>
<p><strong>Soil and Climate.</strong>&mdash;The chestnut thrives best in
    light, well-drained soils, and those containing a large
    proportion of sand or decomposed quartz, slate, or volcanic
    scoria; but it is rarely found, nor does it succeed,
    in heavy clays, limestone soils, or on the rich western
    prairies, where we might think it would grow most luxuriantly.
    That limestone soils are inimical to the chestnut
    has often been disputed, but my own observations,
    which have been somewhat extensive in years and range
    of country, rather confirm the impression that this tree
    avoids land containing any considerable percentage of
    lime. It is true that chestnut groves, and sometimes
    extensive forests, are found on hills and ridges overlying
    limestone, but a careful examination of the soil among
    the trees will show that it is a drift deposit containing
    little or no lime. Such groves can be found in all the
    southern tier of counties of New York, also among the
    hills of northern and western parts of New Jersey, and
    thence west and south along the Blue Ridge and Alleghany
    mountains to the Carolinas, and westward in
    Tennessee and Kentucky. The chestnut is sometimes
    found in New Jersey and other northern Atlantic States
    growing in considerable abundance near streams only
    a few feet above sea level, but when found in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> situations the subsoil is invariably sand, gravel or porous
    shale.</p>
<p>The range of climate in which the native sweet
    chestnut thrives is quite extensive, as it is found sparingly
    in Maine in latitude 44°, extending westward,&mdash;but
    not very abundant on this line,&mdash;through New England
    and New York, crossing the Niagara river, skirting
    the north shore of Lake Erie in Canada, and thence into
    southern Michigan, but does not reach Illinois. From
    this line southward it increases in abundance in Virginia,
    western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee and
    Kentucky. But in following this tree southward we
    meet another indigenous species, widely known as the
    chinquapin (<i>Castanea pumila</i>). This species is indigenous
    to southern New Jersey, and sparingly in parts of
    Pennsylvania, becoming more plentiful as we proceed
    southward, the two species named overlapping and in
    part occupying the same region; but the chinquapin
    extends further south, and also to the westward, near its
    northern limits crossing the Mississippi into southern
    Missouri, then extends south again, becoming quite
    abundant in Arkansas.</p>
<p>The European chestnut, in its many varieties, extends
    over about the same number of degrees of latitude
    in Europe as our species do here, although reaching a
    higher latitude in countries bordering on the Atlantic,
    as shown in the old chestnut trees of England. The
    Oriental chestnut has also a very wide range, but the
    limits are not so well known as those of the European
    and American species; but a study of its geographical
    distribution is of considerable importance, now that we
    are importing these nuts for cultivation. The same is
    also true of the European varieties, and the cultivator
    who neglects to take this matter into consideration will
    fail to secure whatever advantages may have accrued
    from acclimation, an agency which, undoubtedly, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> been active and continuous in modifying and changing
    the primary characteristics of these plants during unknown
    ages.</p>
<p>To more fully impress upon the reader the importance
    of care in the selection of materials to be employed
    in any pursuit with which he is not perfectly familiar,
    I am prompted to relate the story of my first personal
    experience in chestnut culture, as it may serve as a warning
    to others who may attempt to raise these nuts in a
    cold climate.</p>
<p>At the time of purchasing the farm which has been
    my home for the past thirty years, nut trees of various
    kinds were on my list of things wanted, and the chestnut
    occupied a leading position, probably because there
    were already many old and large native trees on the
    place. My first planting consisted of a number of imported
    seedlings, obtained from a well-known French
    nursery. The trees were three or four years old, very
    stocky and vigorous, and they made a good growth the
    first season; but the following winter the young shoots
    were all frozen down to old wood, with the exception of
    one tree, and thinking that this might prove hardy,
    cions were taken from it and set in thrifty sprouts growing
    in a grove near by. The cions made rapid growth,
    and from one of these I soon had a large tree, which remained
    in good health for twenty years, but during all
    that time it produced but one bur, containing two half-developed
    nuts. Why it was unfruitful I do not pretend
    to know, but it was certainly not for want of company, for
    it had large native chestnut trees all about it, and these
    bearing heavy crops. The seedling trees planted in the
    orchard also failed to be fruitful, and were finally dug
    up and burned. Thus ended my first experiment in the
    cultivation of the European chestnut. Had my location
    been farther south and in a milder climate, the experiment
    might have ended differently, but I am relating experience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> and not attempting to guess what might have
    been the results under more favorable conditions. In
    the meantime, however, I had seen a few trees of the
    Japan chestnut bearing on Long Island, and had received
    specimens of the Numbo and Paragon, two now
    well-known and superior varieties of the European species,
    although raised in this country. These varieties
    were secured, and succeeded so well that I have continued
    to add others from time to time, or as soon as trees
    or cions were obtainable.</p>
<p>The success which appears to have attended the
    propagation and dissemination of these two varieties of
    European parentage has awakened considerable interest
    in chestnut culture, besides attracting the attention of
    those interested in such matters to the fact that there
    are many old trees of the same or similar origin scattered
    about the country, awaiting the coming nut culturist to
    propagate them and make known their merits.</p>
<p>It may be well, before leaving this subject, to remind
    the novice in chestnut culture that seedlings of
    these hardy and productive descendants of the European
    species will not come true from the nut or seed, and
    while it will be admitted that the chances are somewhat
    better for procuring a hardy variety from such nuts
    than from those imported, still, there is no certainty of
    any considerable number being equal in hardiness or
    other respects to the parent tree. There is an inherent
    tendency, in tree seedlings of all kinds, to revert to the
    wild form or type, and the chestnut is no exception to
    this rule.</p>

<p><strong>Species of Chestnut.</strong>&mdash;What is called a &quot;species,&quot;
    among plants, is a particular form or type supposed to
    have descended from one original stock, whether this
    was composed of one or more individuals. But variations
    doubtless occurred at the first inception or multiplication
    of the original, but so long as the offsprings do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> not differ so widely as to be untraceable to the proemial
    types, they are held to be varieties of one species.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>
<p>Whether all the chestnuts found in the various
    countries of the world are descendants of one original
    tree or group of trees is now beyond our ability to determine;
    consequently, what are now termed species rests
    very much upon the opinions of botanists, as may readily
    be demonstrated by consulting the works of hundreds
    of authors who have essayed to describe and classify the
    plants of any locality or country, and this, too, without
    reaching an absolute finality acceptable to their contemporaries,
    or at all likely to share a better fate with posterity.</p>
<p>For many years after botany began to be recognized
    as a science, the common American sweet chestnut was
    considered a distinct species, but in recent years it has
    been relegated to the position of a widely distributed
    variety of the European chestnut, and it is so described
    and classified in most of the botanical works of the present
    time, and under such names as <i>Castanea vesca</i>, variety <i>Americana</i>; <i>Castanea sativa</i>, variety <i>Americana</i>; <i>Castanea vulgaris</i>, variety <i>Americana</i>, etc.</p>
<p>The Asiatic species or varieties&mdash;under whichever
    cognomen we may find them described in botanical
    works&mdash;have fared little better than our American kinds,
    for some botanists have described the Japan chestnut as
    a distinct species, while others only as a widely divergent
    variety of the common European chestnut.</p>
<p>I regret that there should be any need of giving so
    much space to this matter of species and varieties, yet
    presuming that far the larger number of my readers will
    not be professional botanists, nor persons with a botanical
    library at hand to consult for unfamiliar terms, I
    have thought this explanation in regard to classification
    might assist them in making clear the apparent confusion
    of names which, in the main, are only synonyms.
    Furthermore, I purpose retaining some of the older specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> names of the distinct groups of varieties, whether
    it be strictly in accord with the ideas of eminent authorities
    or otherwise, because it will be more convenient to
    do so, and certain phases will
    thus be made clearer to the
    practical cultivators of nut
    trees, for whom this work is
    written. My wish is to assist
    those who do not know, but
    want to learn how to obtain,
    plant and make nut trees grow
    and bear remunerative crops.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Castanea Americana</span> (<i>American sweet chestnut</i>).&mdash;Leaves

    skin thin, fibrous, but not as bitter as in the European
    varieties, and the kernel somewhat finer grained and
    sweeter. Trees of moderate growth and are said to rarely
    exceed fifty feet high in Japan. The growth is slender
    in comparison with the European or American chestnut,
    and the habit is decidedly bushy, the new growth of the
    season usually producing a number of lateral twigs late
    in summer. The leaves here seem to be more persistent,
    probably because the season is not long enough to insure
    thorough ripening.</p>
<p>The reader will please bear in mind that this description
    of the Japan chestnut is drawn from the introduced
    varieties or those raised from the imported nuts,
    and not from the trees growing in their native habitats.
    All the varieties that I have seen appear to belong to
    one type or species, and they come from the warmer
    parts of that country; but Prof. Sargent, in his &quot;Forest
    Flora of Japan,&quot; says that while the largest nuts appear
    in the markets of Kobe and Osaka, from whence they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> come to this country, there are varieties offered for sale
    in the markets of Aomori, which is much further north,
    and these, he thinks, would produce a more hardy race
    of varieties than those we have already received from
    that country. As a race, all the Japan chestnuts are
    very precocious, the trees coming into bearing early
    whether raised from the nut or propagated by grafting.</p>
<p><strong>Native Varieties.</strong> (Group One).&mdash;While it is well
    known that our American sweet chestnut varies widely
    in the size, flavor, form, color and general appearance of
    the nuts, no special effort has been made to select and
    perpetuate the most distinct and valuable varieties.
    This is to be regretted, inasmuch as the opportunities
    for making such selections, and preserving and propagating
    those most worthy of it, are rapidly passing away
    with the destruction of our chestnut forests; but there
    is still time to do something in this direction, and perhaps
    save a few varieties as valuable as those already
    destroyed. It is to be hoped that every man who knows
    of a large variety, will either propagate it himself, or
    point it out to some one who is sufficiently interested to
    do so. If proper attention was given to the raising of
    seedlings, we might soon secure many improved native
    varieties, and I would urge this mode of propagation
    upon all whose circumstances and surroundings will admit
    of it, and especially upon the young men who possess
    the talent and inclination to make such experiments;
    for there is a wide and fertile field open to them, and
    they can scarcely fail to reap a rich reward for their
    labors, if applied with earnestness and a moderate
    amount of intelligence.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Burless chestnut.</span>&mdash;This is a peculiar variety or
    freak, in which the burs are merely shallow cups upon
    which the nuts rest, and at no stage of their growth are
    they enclosed in a husk or bur. The nuts are small and
    usually perfect, but being unprotected they are preyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> upon by birds and squirrels as soon as the kernels are
    well formed, few escaping to reach maturity. This
    chestnut is of no economic value, but is worth preserving
    as an illustration of extremes in variation. The
    original tree was found in the forest near Freehold,
    Green Co., N. Y., by Mr. Harry Bagley, to whom I am
    indebted for cions sent me in the spring of 1885.
    Another and very similar variety was found about the
    same time on Staten Island, N. Y., and this also has
    been propagated, to a limited extent, as a curiosity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hathaway.</span>&mdash;A very large and handsome native
    variety, and one of the very best. A strong and vigorous
    grower, and productive. Raised by Mr. B. Hathaway,
    the veteran and widely known pomologist of Little
    Prairie Ronde, Mich. Some thirty years ago Mr. Hathaway
    purchased a half bushel of native chestnuts of a
    dealer in Ohio, and from these raised a large number of
    trees for sale; but a few were reserved for planting out
    on his own grounds, and when these came into bearing
    the one named here was selected for propagation, because
    of its large size and productiveness.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Phillips.</span>&mdash;A large and handsome variety of excellent
    flavor, with a very smooth, dark-brown shell.
    Grafted trees exceedingly vigorous, upright growth, as
    well as precocious and productive. The original tree is
    growing in the grounds of the late Whitman Phillips, at
    Ridgewood, N. J. Several years ago my attention was
    called to a number of large varieties of the chestnut
    growing in and near the village, and from these I obtained
    cions for propagation; but I name only one at
    this time, reserving the others until more fully tested.</p>

    ONE-HALF NATURAL SIZE.</span> </div>
<p>This is rather an insignificant number of varieties
    to be named among the many hundreds that are to be
    found in almost every town or neighborhood where the
    chestnut is a native, and yet I have been able to find
    only one named in nurserymen's catalogues as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> propagated by grafting. It is true that nearly all dealers
    in trees offer seedling American chestnuts, which
    may mean good, bad or indifferent varieties when the
    trees come into bearing. Among all of the many thousands
    that have been raised and planted in the East and
    West, beyond the natural range of the chestnut, as, for
    instance, in Missouri, Kansas and Iowa, there must be
    some distinct and valuable varieties worthy of names
    and propagation. There are not only distinct varieties
    to be found in every forest, but in some instances the
    entire product of an extended area of country are distinct
    in their color, size, and general appearance of the
    nuts produced; as, for instance, in the woolly chestnuts
    of the Piedmont district of Virginia, these being so
    nearly covered with a white down that they remind one
    of popcorn. Hundreds of bushels of these woolly chestnuts
    come to our markets, and among them I have often
    found very large specimens, but so far as known, no
    effort has been made to perpetuate them.</p>
<p>So far as can now be determined, the wild or original
    European chestnut was much inferior in its flavor,
    and little, if any, larger than our American sweet chestnut;
    but by continued selections of the largest for planting,
    and propagation by grafting, it has attained to its
    present size and excellence; but this system of improving
    our native varieties has scarcely, as yet, been attempted,
    a fact which does not, in the least, redound to
    our credit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bush chinquapin</span> (<i>C. nana.</i> Muhlenberg).&mdash;Of
    this I do not know of any named varieties in cultivation.
    Plants are occasionally seen in cultivated grounds, and I
    have one in my garden growing in a sheltered position,
    where it has fruited for several years. It is a pretty,
    round-headed, silvery-leaved bush, about six feet high;
    ornamental, if not specially valuable for other purposes,
    although the little sweet nuts are always acceptable. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> a rule, the seedlings of this species are not hardy in the
    Northern States, but an occasional one will survive if
    planted in a light, porous soil and a protected situation.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Common chinquapin</span> (<i>C. pumila.</i> Miller).&mdash;This
    is a small tree, sometimes thirty to forty feet high;
    found sparingly as far north as central New Jersey, and
    on Long Island. It is more common in cultivation than
    the bush chinquapin, probably because more hardy and
    better known, but I do not know of any improved varieties
    that have been disseminated under distinct names
    except the one hereinafter described.</p>
<p>Among many seedlings raised, of this species, I have
    selected one which good judges of such things have
    thought worthy of propagation, and as I do not raise
    plants for sale, no
    one will be likely
    to accuse me of
    having any selfish
    motives, further
    than a pardonable
    pride in producing
    something worthy
    of perpetuation.
    Furthermore, as
    an earnest of my
    confidence in its
    merits, I have distributed
    it under
    my own name.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"> <img src="images/fig25.jpg" alt="" height="452" width="450" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._25" id="FIG._25">FIG. 25</a>. FULLER'S CHINQUAPIN. FIVE YEARS OLD FROM NUT.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Fuller's
    chinquapin.</span>&mdash;Leaves
    large,
    broadly oval, pointed, coarsely serrate, pale green above,
    clear silvery white below. Bark on main stem; branches
    and twigs smooth, light gray, with numerous white
    dots. The young twigs thick and stocky, cylindrical,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> with moderately prominent, grayish buds. Burs in long
    racemes (Fig. 24), very large for this species; spines
    long, strong, branching and sharp. Nuts only one in
    each bur, rather short, broad, top-shaped, with blunt
    point; shell very smooth, glossy, almost black; kernel
    fine-grained and sweet. Ripens early, or with the earliest
    of the native sweet chestnuts. The original tree is
    only six years old, twice transplanted, and is now ten
    feet high, with a head fully as broad, and as shown in
    Fig. 25. Although growing in a rather exposed position,
    it has never been injured by low temperature in
    winter or a high one in summer. It has thus far been
    the most rapid-growing chestnut tree in my grounds,
    although given no special care. Whether it will eventually
    become a large tree, or soon cease to extend, is, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> course, a question to be answered at some future time,
    but from present indications this tree will be well worthy
    of cultivation as an ornamental shade tree, even if we
    leave out of the account its rapid growth, productiveness,
    and delicious little nuts, which will be very acceptable
    for home use, if not possessing any great commercial
    value.</p>
<p><strong>European Varieties.</strong>&mdash;In the use of this term I
    wish it understood that the varieties named and described
    in this group are all of American origin; that is, raised
    in this country from seed. At the same time they are
    descendants of the European species. They are, in other
    words, &quot;Survivals of the fittests,&quot; the few that have
    survived the many being raised from imported nuts (perhaps
    one out of a thousand) that tests and time have shown
    were adapted to our climate. There may be many other
    varieties scattered about the country which are worthy
    of a name and of propagation, but I can speak only of
    those I have been able to procure, or that have been
    brought to my notice.</p>
<p>In describing the following varieties, and in seeking
    to get at the facts relating to their origin, name and
    history, the reader will please bear in mind that there
    has been no previous attempt to arrange or classify these
    semi-American varieties. Furthermore, there is much
    confusion in regard to the true names of a number of
    them, and the most I can say is that I have endeavored,
    under the circumstances, to get as near the truth as possible.
    Could I defer writing this chapter ten years, some
    moot points might be cleared up, but as this is out of
    the question I must follow the light already in my
    possession.</p>
<p>To Mr. John R. Parry, of Parry, N. J., I am greatly
    indebted, not only for specimens of new and rare varieties,
    but also notes relating to the history of several of
    the older ones.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Comfort.</span>&mdash;Burs very large, broad, somewhat flattened;
    spines very strong and long, branching; nuts
    very broad, with short point, and shell covered from
    base to point with scattering silky hairs, thicker at upper
    end. In quality, about the same as in the ordinary varieties
    of the species, but to some persons' taste it is better,
    having less astringency in the skin surrounding the
    kernel. Origin uncertain, but said to have been grown
    for many years at Germantown, a suburb of Philadelphia,
    Pa., where the Paragon chestnut was discovered. The
    Comfort certainly closely resembles the Paragon, but I
    have not had an opportunity of fruiting trees under the
    two names side by side, as would be necessary to determine
    their identity or difference, if they are really
    distinct.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/fig26.jpg" alt="" height="485" width="500" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._26" id="FIG._26">FIG. 26</a>. BUR OF NUMBO CHESTNUT.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Cooper.</span>&mdash;A very large variety; has been in cultivation
    for several years in Camden Co., N. J., but up to
    the present time the trees have not been propagated for
    sale, although I am informed by Mr. John R. Parry
    that there are a large number under cultivation. The
    tree is described as of a broad spreading habit, with
    enormously large leaves, and immensely productive.
    Nuts very large, smooth and glossy, with little fuzz
    near the top. In quality they may be considered excellent
    for a variety of this class. The burs are very large,
    and this is its greatest or only fault; for when nearly
    mature they absorb and retain such a quantity of water
    during heavy rains, in addition to the original weight
    and the enclosed nuts, that the trees are liable to be
    broken down by strong winds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Corson.</span>&mdash;Burs of immense size; spines an inch or
    more in length, from a stout, woody, irregularly branching
    stem, resting on the moderately thin husk. Nuts
    extra large, usually three in a bur; shell dark brown,
    somewhat ridged; the upper end or point of the shell
    densely covered with a white, almost woolly, pubescence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> or fuzz as it is usually termed. This is a remarkably
    large and fine variety and of good quality. Originated
    with Mr. Walter H. Corson, Plymouth Meeting, Montgomery
    Co., Pa.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dager.</span>&mdash;A large variety originated near Wyoming,
    Delaware, from seed of the Ridgely. My specimen trees
    are good vigorous growers, and hardy, but have not, as
    yet, produced fruit. It is said that the nuts are of fair
    quality, but not as good as the best of its class.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moncur.</span>&mdash;Another seedling of the Ridgely, raised
    on the farm of Mr. Frank Moncur, near Dover, Del.
    The original tree is about thirty years old. Described
    as smaller than its parent, but of better quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Numbo.</span>&mdash;Burs medium, and distinctly long pointed
    before opening, as shown in Fig. 26, the four divisions of
    the burs extending an inch or more beyond the nut as
    they open. This is an
    exceptional form of
    the bur, and will enable
    almost any person
    to recognize the variety
    with bearing trees.
    Spines only medium
    in length (Fig. 27),
    and not as strong as in
    most other varieties of this species. Nuts very large
    (Fig. 28), smooth, decidedly pointed, light brown when
    first mature, and of good flavor.
    Tree hardy and a vigorous,
    free grower, and is
    very productive even when
    young. The original tree is
    now some forty years old,
    and is one of a large number
    raised from imported nuts,
    by the late Mahlon Moon, of

<p><span class="smcap">Miller's Dupont.</span>&mdash;Burs

<p><span class="smcap">Paragon.</span>&mdash;Burs of immense size, often five inches
    and more in lateral diameter; distinctly flattened on the
    top, or cushion shape (Fig. 29); spines an inch in
    length, widely and irregularly branching from a stout
    stem springing from a thick, fleshy husk, as shown in
    Fig. 30, the whole making an involucre or bur out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> proportion to the nuts within. Nuts of large size,
    slightly depressed at the top (Fig. 31), and they are
    usually broader than long; shell very dark brown,
    slightly ridged, and covered with a fine but not very
    conspicuous pubescence. Kernel sweet, fine-grained,
    and of superior flavor for one of this species. Tree hardy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> exceedingly precocious and productive when grafted on
    strong, healthy stock. A four-year-old tree on my
    grounds is shown in Fig. 32. It was loaded with nuts
    in the fall of 1894. This is one of the best of its class.
    Origin somewhat in doubt, but it is claimed that the
    late W. L. Shaffer, of Philadelphia, raised it from a foreign
    nut planted in his garden, and who, some eighteen
    years or more ago, gave cions to W. H. Engle, of
    Marietta, Pa. Mr. Engle
    has since propagated and
    disseminated this variety
    quite extensively under its
    present name, but should
    further investigation prove
    it to be distinct and that
    it was raised by Mr. Shaffer,
    then it should certainly
    bear his name, and Paragon
    become a synonym.
    No more appropriate monument
    could possibly be erected in honor of a distinguished
    horticulturist like the late Mr. Shaffer, than a
    chestnut tree, nor could his memory be perpetuated
    under more pleasant and agreeable surroundings than
    to have his name linked inseparably with such an excellent
    and valuable variety.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"> <img src="images/fig32.jpg" alt="" height="532" width="450" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._32" id="FIG._32">FIG. 32</a>. FOUR YEAR OLD PARAGON CHESTNUT TREE.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Ridgely.</span>&mdash;Burs large, with dense spines, but not
    as long as those of the Paragon. Nuts large, pointed;
    shell dark brown, with very little pubescence, and this
    mainly at the point (Fig. 33). In quality this variety
    ranks very near, if not the equal of, the best of its class,
    and it has been highly commended, by those who have
    been acquainted with it, for many years.</p>
<p>The origin of the Ridgely, as recorded, leaves the
    question of name a debatable one. Some sixty years
    ago a Mr. Dupont, of Wilmington, Del., gave or sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> Mr. D. M. Ridgely, of Dover, Del., a sprouted chestnut,
    and this was planted and became the original tree
    of the variety under consideration. It has been called
    Dupont, because he raised the nut and kept it over winter
    and until it sprouted; then it passed into the care of
    Mr. Ridgely, who thenceforward gave it his attention.
    The tree is now of immense size, and some seasons has
    produced more than five bushels of nuts, selling at eleven
    dollars per bushel. It is quite probable that the Dupont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> family were the first to raise European chestnut trees to
    a bearing size in this country, for some of its members
    were settled in Delaware before the war of the Revolution.
    Pierre Samuel Dupont de Nemours, during the
    French ministry of Vergennes, was employed in forming
    the treaty of 1783, in which the independence of the
    United States was formally recognized by England. In
    1795 (Am. encyclopedia) he came to this country and
    joined his sons, who had become successful manufacturers
    of gunpowder at or near Wilmington, Del., where
    their descendants, or at least some of them, are still engaged
    in the same business. If any of the old and original
    chestnut trees have escaped the numerous &quot;powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> mill explosions&quot; which have frequently occurred in that
    neighborhood, they are probably much older than the
    Ridgely. I am also inclined to believe that a very large
    majority of all the hardy chestnut trees of the European
    species scattered about the country are the direct descendants
    of the old Dupont stock.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"> <img src="images/fig33.jpg" alt="" height="472" width="450" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._33" id="FIG._33">FIG. 33</a>. OPEN BUR OF THE RIDGELY CHESTNUT.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Scott.</span>&mdash;Burs large, with long branching spines.
    Nuts from the original tree, as received the past season,
    are only of medium size, but said to be much larger on
    younger trees. Shell dark brown, smooth, with a little
    fuzz around the point. As my specimen tree has not,
    as yet, fruited, I am unable to say anything of its productiveness
    from personal experience, but in a note from
    Mr. William Parry, under date of Oct. 15, 1894, he
    says: &quot;I send specimens of the Scott chestnuts, grown
    by Judge Scott, of Burlington, N. J. The crop is about
    gone and it was with difficulty I could get these, which
    are about the average size; earlier in the season many
    are larger. Judge Scott has grown those nuts for market
    several years. The original tree was bought by his
    father many years ago from the nursery of Thomas
    Hancock. He bought three trees for Spanish chestnuts,
    planted them in a row about thirty feet apart, and
    the one from which these nuts were obtained happened
    to be in the middle. It is now a large tree, the trunk
    about five feet in diameter. It is a regular and heavy
    bearer. Judge Scott has propagated and planted an
    orchard from this variety, and claims among its important
    features, large size and early bearing,&mdash;two-year
    grafts generally produce nuts; immense productiveness
    and good quality; beautiful, glossy, mahogany color; freedom
    from fuzz, and an almost entire exemption from the
    attacks of the chestnut weevil. While the crop of two
    trees standing on either side of the Scott is badly damaged
    by worms, it is the exception to find a wormy nut
    among the Scott.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The crop sells readily at ten to twelve dollars per
        bushel. This year (1894) some sold as low as eight dollars,
        the lowest ever known for this variety.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Styer.</span>&mdash;Burs large, round; spines long, branching,
    but not as coarse as those of Comfort. Nuts medium to
    large, decidedly pointed, and the point fuzzy. Shell
    dark brown, with a few longitudinal stripes, but not
    ridged. A handsome nut of good quality. This variety
    has been distributed under the name of Hannum. The
    original tree, which is a mammoth in size, is still standing
    on the farm of a Mr. Hannum, near Concordville,
    Delaware Co., Penn. But Mr. T. Walter Styer, of the
    same place, is propagating and introducing it as the
    Styer.</p>
<p>Some of the varieties in this group may not prove
    to be distinct, and later they will be relegated to their
    proper place as synonyms, but I have thought it best to
    record them by the names under which they have been
    received. In writing these descriptions I have had the
    nuts and leaves before me, but there may be characters
    overlooked which will become more conspicuous as the
    grafted trees become older and more mature. The
    Dager chestnut, from Delaware, is a promising variety,
    disseminated through the Department of Agriculture,
    but as I have not seen the nuts at this writing, a description
    is necessarily omitted.</p>
<p>Among the French varieties of this species which
    are said to succeed admirably in California, a large proportion
    would probably do equally well in Delaware and
    further south. Among those worthy of trial I may
    name the <i>Avant Chataigne</i>, <i>Comale</i>, <i>Exalade</i>, <i>Green
    of Lemousin</i>, <i>Grosse Précoce</i>, <i>Jaune Rousse</i>, <i>Lyons</i>, <i>Merle</i>, <i>Nouzillard</i>, <i>Quercy</i>, etc. I have tried some of
    these, but with such indifferent results that they were
    abandoned. Cultivators of nut trees located in a milder
    climate, should take advantage of whatever improvements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> there have been made in Europe, by importing
    grafted trees or cions. There are a few ornamental varieties
    of the European chestnut, but none worthy of any
    special attention.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"> <img src="images/fig34.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="450" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._34" id="FIG._34">FIG. 34</a>. JAPAN GIANT CHESTNUT.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Japan Chestnuts.</span>&mdash;The first authentic account I
    have been able to find of the introduction of the Japan
    chestnut into this country, is of a number of trees received
    by S. B. Parsons &amp; Co., Flushing, N. Y., 1876,
    from the late Thos. Hogg, who, as is well known to all
    horticulturists, spent several years in Japan collecting
    many rare kinds of trees and shrubs, which were shipped
    direct to Parsons &amp; Co.  The chestnut trees received in
    1876 fruited two years later, or in 1878, and soon attracted
    attention, on account of the large size and excellent
    quality of the nuts and the precocious habits of the trees.</p>
<p>The success of this typical variety of the Japanese
    species, as I have assumed to designate it, proved that
    there were oriental chestnuts&mdash;heretofore untested in
    this country&mdash;that were certainly worthy of an attempt
    to obtain. This variety, introduced by the Messrs.
    Parsons &amp; Co., does not appear to have been disseminated
    under any distinct varietal name, but merely bears
    the rather meaningless one of Japan chestnut, and
    for the purpose of giving it a position where it may be
    recognized&mdash;by name at least&mdash;from other varieties more
    recently introduced, I shall take the liberty of calling it
    &quot;Parsons' Japan.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon after it became known that the oriental chestnuts
    would succeed in this country, the fruit growers
    and nurserymen of California began to import and plant
    these nuts, shipping an occasional lot to their customers
    in the Eastern States, and from these hundreds of seedlings
    have been raised and distributed, under the general
    name of Japan chestnut. Among the nuts imported
    there are some of extraordinary size, even larger than
    anything of the kind obtained from Europe, as shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> in Fig. 34, natural size, and from a specimen received
    direct from Japan. Some of the nurserymen who have
    secured these very large nuts for planting, offer the
    seedlings raised
    therefrom under
    such names as
    Mammoth and
    Giant Japan, but
    as there is no
    certainty, and
    scarcely a probability,
    that such
    seedlings will
    produce nuts as
    large as those
    planted, the
    names are rather misleading, although proper enough if
    given to grafted varieties of large size. When an extra-fine
    variety is produced from the nut, it should, of
    course, be preserved and propagated in the usual way.</p>

<p>The late Wm. Parry, of Parry, N. J., was one of
    the first nurserymen to attempt to produce new varieties
    of the Japan chestnut in this country, and his sons have
    continued his experiments
    in this direction.
    Others may have been
    equally successful, but I
    have been unable to obtain
    any satisfactory reports
    from those to
    whom I have applied for
    information; consequently, I can only say that the following,
    with few exceptions, originated at the Wm.
    Parry nurseries.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Advance</span> (Parry).&mdash;Burs medium, slightly flattened
    on top; spines medium, short, almost sessile, as shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> in Fig. 35, and this is a characteristic of all the Japan
    chestnuts; branching and widely separated on a very
    thin husk. Nuts very large; shell a light yellowish
    brown, with a few slight darker streaks from base to
    apex. Quality excellent for one of this species. Ripens
    early, and long before touched by frost.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Alpha</span> (Parry).&mdash;Very similar to the last, but
    ripens earlier, which would be an advantage in some
    localities. Tree vigorous and productive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Beta</span> (Parry).&mdash;Bur medium; spines rather long
    and thin for one of this group, set on a thin husk. Nut
    large; shell light brown, smooth, with a slight trace of
    pubescence near the tip. The leaves are shallow and
    coarsely serrate, and on some the teeth or serratures are
    entirely wanting. Ripens a little later than the Alpha,
    or about the first of October in northern New Jersey.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Early Reliance</span> (Parry).&mdash;Burs medium, with
    short, almost deflexed spines, on an exceedingly thin
    husk. Nuts large, more pointed than in the last, and
    of a lighter color the past season, but this may not be
    constant, and may be due to the long and severe drouth
    of the summer of 1894. Usually three nuts in a bur, and
    sometimes four or five, but I do not consider this increase
    in number a merit in any variety, for where there
    are more than three they are likely to be of small size
    and very much deformed. The original tree of the Reliance
    is enormously productive, and a regular bearer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Felton.</span>&mdash;A seedling of the common Japanese
    chestnut, raised by J. W. Killen, of Felton, Delaware.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Giant Japan</span> (Parry).&mdash;Burs large to extra large
    for a variety of this species, with medium low branching
    spines on a very thin, parchment-like husk. Nuts extra
    large, usually only two in a bur, often only one, and
    about two inches broad, much depressed at the top, with
    a short point set in an irregular depression or basin.
    Shell dark mahogany color, more or less ribbed; kernel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> coarse grained, as is usual in the extra large varieties of
    nearly all species of the chestnut. This is probably the
    largest variety of the Japanese chestnut raised in this
    country, of which grafted trees are obtainable at this
    time. There may be others equally as large, but if so
    they are unknown to the writer.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Killen.</span>&mdash;Of the Japan species, and described as
    very large, the nuts over two inches in diameter and of
    fair quality. Raised by J. W. Killen, of Felton, Del.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Parsons' Japan.</span>&mdash;Burs medium, with rather thick-set
    and long spines. Nuts large, one inch and a half
    broad, curving regularly to a point; shell smooth,
    almost glossy, brown, with faint stripes of a darker shade
    extending from base to apex. In quality the kernel is
    far better than most of the European varieties, being
    finer grained and sweeter. When grafted on strong
    stocks the trees come into bearing early, or in two or
    three years. This is the best known, and probably the
    most widely distributed variety, of the Japanese species
    in this country, having been introduced, as I have stated
    elsewhere, in 1876.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Parry's Superb</span> (Parry).&mdash;Burs broad, cushion-shaped,
    or much flattened on top, with extra long,
    widely branching spines from single or multiple stems,
    very much as in the European varieties. But the thin
    husk, the nuts, and the growth of tree, wood and leaves,
    stamp it as a pure Japanese variety. Nuts large, broader
    than long, with a decided sharp woody point; almost
    entirely destitute of even a sign of pubescence. A very
    promising and distinct variety.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Success</span> (Parry).&mdash;Burs very large, broad, with
    only a few short, scattering, branching spines on the
    top, thicker toward the base; on a thin, parchment-like
    husk, and this is so thin that it sometimes cracks open
    and exposes the nuts within before they are fully ripe.
    Nuts extra large, nearly equal to the Giant, but of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> more regular and symmetrical form, being nearly as long
    as broad, tapering to a point. Shell smooth, dark
    brown, with a slight pubescence about the point. Usually
    three nuts in a bur; an ideal variety in every respect.</p>
<p>There is a variety of the Japan chestnut recently
    much lauded under the name of Mammoth or Burbank,
    which is said to be of immense size, and as sweet as the
    common American chestnut.</p>
<p><strong>Injurious Insects.</strong>&mdash;The chestnut tree is rarely
    attacked by insects. It is true that grubs may occasionally
    be found boring into the wood or cutting sinuous
    burrows under the bark, but this is mainly in trees weakened
    by exposure, in removing protecting companions,
    as when removing forests, or by plowing up and destroying
    the roots, in cultivating the land about them; but
    the attacks of insects upon such specimens is nature's
    way of getting rid of the feeble and least valuable, making
    room for the healthy and strong. But my thirty
    years' residence in a chestnut grove leads me to think
    that this nut tree is exceedingly free from wood borers
    of any kind.</p>
<p>Entomologists, however, have noted several instances
    of insect depredations upon individual trees, by a few
    species of the long-horn beetles, three or four in all, but
    these occur so rarely that they are scarcely worthy of
    notice as pests of the chestnut. There are also several
    species of caterpillars occasionally found feeding on the
    leaves of this tree, also some sucking bugs or tree hoppers,
    and two or three kinds of plant lice, but none of
    these have, as yet, become at all formidable enemies, or
    likely to become so later. But the chestnut has one
    enemy which is so abundant and destructive to the nuts
    as to call for an extended notice. I refer to the common
    native chestnut weevil (<i>Balaninus carytripes</i>, Boheman).
    The little fat, white, round, legless grubs, nearly or quite
    a half-inch long, must be familiar to every person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> has handled or eaten chestnuts raised in this country,
    whether of the exotic or native varieties. The parents
    of this grub are oval-shaped beetles about one-half inch
    long or less; wing covers, body and legs densely covered
    with a short yellow down, and from the front or thorax
    there extends a long, slightly curved, slender snout (Fig.
    36), sometimes nearly an inch in length in the females,
    but usually less in the males. The mouth parts are at
    the extreme end of this snout or proboscis, and the female,
    with her mandibles, it is claimed, reaches down
    among the chestnut spines and gnaws a hole
    in the husk, into which she drops an egg;
    and when this hatches, the minute grub cuts
    its way through the green husk and into the
    nut, the hole made in its progress closing
    up behind, leaving no mark or scar. Although
    I have taken hundreds of these weevils
    on chestnut trees, I never have been so
    fortunate as to take one in the act of ovipositing,
    but have come so near it as to find
    the ovipositor still extended as the insect crawled out
    from among the spines.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;"> <img src="images/fig36.jpg" alt="" height="292" width="200" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._36" id="FIG._36">FIG. 36</a>. CHESTNUT
    WEEVIL.</span> </div>
<p>The chestnut weevil usually appears in great numbers
    soon after the trees bloom in spring, but they continue
    to come out all through the summer; I have
    occasionally found them late in September, which probably
    accounts for finding small and half-grown grubs in
    the nuts as they ripen and fall from the trees. These
    late grubs often remain in the nuts all winter, but the
    greater part escape earlier, or very soon after the crop
    is ripe. The grubs crawl out of the nuts and work their
    way into the ground to a depth of from a few inches to
    two feet, much depending upon the nature of the soil.
    Having very powerful jaws, they readily cut through a
    layer of leaves or soft wood, and I have known them to
    cut holes in sheets of dry cork. These grubs remain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> the ground until the following season, then come forth
    in their winged or weevil stage, except the belated,
    broods, or those that have not reached full size in the
    autumn; these remain in the ground the entire summer,
    coming out late in the fall, or pass over until the second
    year, as I have proved by burying the grubs in a barrel
    sunk in the ground, covering the top with fine wire netting,
    to prevent the escape of the weevils as they emerged
    from time to time during the season.</p>
<p>As a rule, we find only one grub in a nut, of the
    American sweet chestnut, but in the larger varieties of
    the European and Japanese, two or more is not unusual,
    which rather favors the idea that the female weevil does
    possess something akin to reason, which guides her in
    locating stores of food available for her progeny. I have
    never observed that the weevils had any choice among
    varieties, all being subject to their attacks alike, provided
    all were growing in equally favorable positions.
    But if the trees are of different sizes, some tall and
    others short, some exposed to the winds and others protected,
    then the ravages of this pest will, no doubt, be
    as variable as the surrounding conditions. As the
    weevils emerge from the ground in spring or early summer,
    they will naturally seek the nuts most convenient
    and on the small trees, then those on the lower branches
    of the larger ones, while those on the upper part of the
    tree, where they are fully exposed to the winds, may
    wholly escape the attacks of these pests. This leads me
    to think that whoever attempts to cut off native chestnut
    forests, with the expectation of renewal with the
    larger varieties, by grafting the sprouts, will find the
    chestnut weevil a rather formidable enemy. I have
    found it so on a limited number of trees in my own
    grounds, that are grown from grafted sprouts near large
    native specimens, the weevils destroying nearly every
    nut; but out in the field, away from the woods, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> where the young trees are scattered and exposed to the
    full sweep of the winds, the nuts are sound and free
    from insect enemies. The only remedy is to collect and
    destroy the weevils, which is not a serious matter where
    only the larger varieties are cultivated.</p>
<p><strong>Diseases of the Chestnut.</strong>&mdash;I have never noticed
    any special disease among chestnuts, neither do I find
    any mentioned in European works on forestry. The
    nearest approach to any such malady being recorded as
    having appeared in this country, is found in a paragraph
    in Hough's &quot;Report on Forestry,&quot; 1877, p. 470, where the
    author copies from Prof. W. C. Kerr, State Geologist,
    North Carolina, as follows: &quot;The chestnut was formerly
    abundant in the Piedmont region, down to the
    country between the Catawba and Yadkin rivers, but
    within the last thirty years they have mostly perished.
    They are now found east of the Blue Ridge only, on
    higher ridges and spurs of the mountains. They have
    suffered injury here, and are dying out both here and
    beyond the Blue Ridge. They are much less fruitful
    than they were a generation ago, and the crop is much
    more uncertain.&quot;</p>
<p>While there is nothing said about any chestnut disease
    in the paragraph quoted, we only infer that the
    author intended to convey the idea that the trees were
    suffering from some endemic malady, although it may
    have been due to long drouths, insect depredators, or
    other causes. A few years later Mr. Hough, in his
    &quot;Elements of Forestry,&quot; refers to the subject again, and
    admits that &quot;the cause of the malady is unknown.&quot;
    But as chestnuts continue to come to our markets in
    vast quantities from the Piedmont regions, there must
    be a goodly number of healthy trees remaining.</p>
<p><strong>Uses.</strong>&mdash;The economic value of the chestnut, as
    food for mankind and the lower animals, has been, and
    is still, so well known, that no extended dissertation or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> compilation of historic instances of its usefulness are
    required here. For almost two thousand years it has
    been an important article of food throughout southern
    Europe, and in some of the mountainous districts it is
    almost the &quot;staff of life&quot; among the poorer people, who
    not only use these nuts in their raw state, but roasted,
    boiled, stewed, and even dried and ground into flour,
    from which a coarse but nutritious kind of cake or bread
    is made. These nuts are also used in the same way by
    the poorer classes of China and Japan, and probably in
    other oriental countries. In France, Italy, Spain and
    Portugal, the chestnut crop is of immense importance,
    not only for domestic use, but commercially, because all
    surplus is wanted by other nations, who are ever ready
    to take a share, and pay a good round price for the same.</p>
<p>In this country chestnuts are mainly used as a luxury
    or a kind of pocket lunch for the children, as they
    are rarely brought to the table, and it is very doubtful
    if the American housewife, or our cooks,&mdash;unless foreign
    born and bred,&mdash;know anything about preparing these
    delicious nuts for comestible purposes. Cereals, meats,
    fruits and vegetables have always been so abundant and
    cheap in this country, that the poorest of the poor could
    indulge in them without stint or limit; but all this will
    change sooner or later, and when our population has
    doubled or trebled, the edible nuts must become of much
    more importance than now, and a roast turkey stuffed
    with chestnuts may figure as the ideal of gastronomic
    art.</p>
<p>As our native chestnuts are now annually consumed
    by the thousands of bushels, and the imported varieties
    by millions of pounds, and all as a mere luxury,&mdash;not a
    necessity nor an article which we could not dispense
    with without any serious inconvenience,&mdash;we may well
    consider what the future demand must be, and make
    haste to meet it with an abundant supply.</p>

<h3>FILBERT OR HAZELNUT.</h3>
<p>Corylus, <i>Tournefort</i>. Name from <i>korys</i>, a hood,
    helmet or bonnet, in reference to the form of the calyx
    or husk enclosing the nut. Order, <i>Corylaceæ</i>. Deciduous
    trees or low shrubs. Male flowers appearing in
    the autumn in pendulous cylindrical catkins two inches
    or more in length, with a two-cleft calyx partly united
    with the bracts or scales. These catkins remain on the
    plants all winter, becoming fully developed, and shedding
    their pollen early the following spring. Female
    flowers minute, entirely hidden within the buds during
    the winter, but early in spring their bright red, thread-like
    stigmas push out from the tips of the lateral or terminal
    buds. Ovary two-celled, with one ovule in each.
    Nut globular, ovoid or oblong, often in clusters, but
    each enclosed in a leafy, two- or three-valved husk,
    fringed or deeply notched at the upper end. Leaves
    broadly heart-shaped, serrate, with sturdy, short leaf-stalks.
    The filbert and hazel always bloom before the
    leaves appear in spring, and the male catkins usually
    open and begin to scatter their pollen in this latitude
    during warm days in March, the females soon following,
    their bright-red stigmas pushing out from the ends of
    the buds, but as soon as fertilization has been consummated
    they shrivel and disappear. The trees may then
    remain leafless for weeks following, and yet produce a
    heavy crop of fruit.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 470px;"> <img src="images/fig37.jpg" alt="" height="540" width="470" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._37" id="FIG._37">FIG. 37</a>. LARGE FILBERT.</span> </div>
<p>The common English name, filbert, is from &quot;full-beard.&quot;
    All the varieties with husks extending beyond
    the nut, and with fringed edges, are filberts (Fig. 37);<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> while those with husks shorter than the nuts (Fig. 38)
    are hazels, from the old Anglo-Saxon word, <i>hæsel</i>, a
    hood or bonnet. The parentage, size, form or quality
    of the nut, is not to be considered in this classification,
    for when the nuts are ripe and fallen from the husks,
    there is nothing left to distinguish the hazelnuts from
    filberts, unless a person is sufficiently familiar with a
    variety to know to which group it belongs. In France
    these nuts are known under the general name of <i>Noysette</i>;
    while in Germany it is <i>Haselnuss</i>; in Holland <i>Hazelnoot</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> and in Italy <i>Avellana</i>, from Avellana, a city of
    Naples, near which there is a valley where these nuts
    have been extensively cultivated for many centuries.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"> <img src="images/fig38.jpg" alt="" height="425" width="550" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._38" id="FIG._38">FIG. 38</a>. LARGE SEEDLING HAZELNUT.</span> </div>
<p><strong>History of the Filbert.</strong>&mdash;It is claimed that the
    filbert was first known to the Romans as <i>Nux Pontica</i>,
    because introduced from Pontus; but it must have become
    naturalized throughout southern Europe in very
    early times. But the Italian name of <i>Avellana</i> appears
    to have been applied to the wild hazel of Britain, long
    before Linnæus adopted it as the specific name of the
    indigenous species. John Evelyn, one of the most careful
    and learned of English arboriculturists of his time,
    in referring to these nuts, in his &quot;Sylva,&quot; 1664, says:
    &quot;I do not confound the filbert Pontic, distinguished by
    its beard, with our foresters or bald hazelnuts, which,
    doubtless, we had from abroad, bearing the names of <i>Avelan</i> or <i>Avelin</i>, as I find in some ancient records and
    deeds in my custody, where my ancestors' names were
    written Avelan, <i>alias</i> Evelin.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>
<p>The filbert has been celebrated in prose and poetry
    from ancient times, as we may infer from a remark of
    Virgil, who says that it has been more honored &quot;than
    the vine, the myrtle, or even the bay itself&quot; (Eclogue vii).</p>
<p>The supposed occult power of a forked twig of the
    hazel as a divining-rod (<i>virgula divinatoria</i>) for finding
    hidden treasures, veins of metals, subterranean streams
    of water, and even pointing out criminals, is, of course,
    purely mythical, although so solemnly attested by many
    learned men in the past; and I would not consider this
    myth worthy of a notice here were it not for the fact
    that it was early imported into this country, and is still
    firmly believed by many persons among our rural population.
    It is true that the supposed attributes of the
    European hazel have been transferred to different plants
    in this country, mainly to the peach and our indigenous
    witch-hazel (<i>Hamamelis Virginiana</i>), but the myth
    still lives, a legitimate descendant of an Old World
    nut tree.</p>
<p>There is little to be said in regard to the history of
    the filbert and hazelnut in this country, but it is quite
    likely that both of the European species, and many varieties,
    were brought here and planted by the early settlers
    in the Eastern States, and bushes of the same could have
    been seen in many gardens a hundred years ago; but I
    have been unable to find any account of extensive plantings
    of these nuts, although nurserymen, all along, have
    been offering choice varieties to their customers. In
    the main, our pomologists have either remained silent in
    regard to these nuts, or, at most, referred to them very
    briefly in their published works.</p>
<p>William Prince, of Flushing, N. Y., in a &quot;Short
    Treatise on Horticulture,&quot; published in 1828, refers to
    the filbert as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;This shrub or, in some cases,
        tree, accommodates itself to every exposition, and to
        every variety of soil, but prefers a moist loam on a sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> bottom, with a northern exposure. It is easily multiplied
        by seeds, layers or inoculation. In fact, these
        nuts, which are vended in large quantities in our markets,
        grow as well in our climate as the common hazelnut,
        and produce very abundantly. Such being the
        case, it is hoped, ere long, sufficient will be produced
        from our soil to supersede the necessity of importation,
        as plantations of this tree would amply remunerate the
        possessor; or if planted as a hedge, would be found to
        be very productive. A single bush of the Spanish filbert
        in my garden has produced a half-bushel annually.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Prince then names a few of the best varieties,
    which are about the same as those recommended at the
    present time, and he was, no doubt, honest in recommending
    filbert culture to his countrymen, for his own
    limited experience proved that the trees would grow
    here and fruit abundantly.</p>
<p>A. J. Downing, in the first edition of his &quot;Fruits
    and Fruit Trees of America,&quot; 1845, says: &quot;The Spanish
    filbert, common in many of our gardens, is a worthless,
    nearly barren variety; but we have found the better
    English sorts productive and excellent in this climate
    (Newburg, N. Y.), and at least a few plants of these
    should have a place in all our gardens.&quot; If a few plants
    will succeed in a garden, then we might reasonably suppose
    that the number might be safely increased, and
    this was the idea of Mr. Prince, and many other writers
    on the subject since his time, but I fail to find any record
    of extended experiments with these nuts in this
    country, and as there must be some good reason for this
    neglect, perhaps my own experience in the cultivation
    of the filbert and hazel, to be given in succeeding pages,
    may throw some light on this question.</p>
<p><strong>Propagation.</strong>&mdash;Filberts are readily propagated by
    almost all the modes employed in the multiplication of
    ordinary fruit trees and shrubs. The nuts are not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> delicate, and may be planted in the fall, or stored in a
    cool place, mixed with sand or sphagnum, and then put
    out in spring, always selecting a rather light and rich
    soil for a seed bed, and in such beds plants from one to
    three feet high may be obtained the first season. The
    seedlings produce such a mass of fine roots that they are
    readily transplanted without danger of loss. Varieties
    are perpetuated and multiplied by budding, grafting,
    suckers, layers, and some grow quite readily from cuttings
    made of the young, vigorous shoots, cut up into
    proper lengths in the fall, and then buried in the ground
    until the following spring, then planted out in trenches,
    as usually practiced with currants, grapes and similar
    plants. The method of propagation most generally
    practiced in Europe and this country is by suckers, and
    as the cultivated varieties of the filbert usually produce
    these from the base of their stems in profusion, there is
    no lack of material; besides, they make as strong,
    healthy and productive plants as can be procured in any
    other way. To secure an extra number of roots on these
    suckers, they should be banked up with a few inches in
    depth of good rich soil, or old manure, about midsummer,
    and then late in the autumn dig down to the base
    and remove with knife or chisel, after which they may
    be headed down to about fifteen or eighteen inches, and
    heeled-in for the winter, to be planted out in nursery
    rows early in spring. If a greater number of sprouts are
    wanted than the plants naturally produce, the main
    stem may be cut down; but this will seldom be necessary,
    because the young transplanted suckers will usually produce
    more or less new ones the first season, all of which
    can be utilized for multiplying the stock if they are
    wanted.</p>
<p><strong>Soil, Location and Climate.</strong>&mdash;European varieties
    of the filbert thrive best in what may be termed a rich
    loam, with a dry subsoil. If the soil is too moist, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> trees are inclined to run too much to wood, producing
    less fruit. In the famous nut orchards of Kent, England,
    the soil is loam upon a dry, sandy rock. The
    trees in these orchards are manured at least once in two
    years, especially after they reach the full bearing age.
    Almost any good soil that is rich enough to produce a
    good crop of corn, and is not submerged in winter, will
    answer for the filbert in this country.</p>
<p>In selecting a location for a filbert orchard, an open,
    airy one would probably be preferable to a spot so sheltered
    as to cause the flowers to appear so early as to be
    injured by frosts. Furthermore, I would warn cultivators
    to keep as far away as possible from any hedgerows
    or plantation of the wild native hazel bushes, for
    these are always loaded with disease germs that are fatal
    to the foreign species. We might reasonably suppose
    that filberts would succeed better in the Southern than
    in the Northern States, but if the experience of those
    who have tried them there count for anything, then
    these nuts are not adapted to the South, owing to the
    fact that the flowers almost invariably push out during
    warm days in winter, and these are destroyed later by
    frosts. In the more elevated regions of the northern
    border of the Southern, and in similar locations in the
    Middle States, these nuts will doubtless thrive, or at
    least the climate will prove congenial. The more equable
    the climate and free from extremes in temperature,
    the better; but the most important element in this
    country is moisture, especially in summer, when the
    nuts are filling out; and the best way to supply this,
    where irrigation cannot be practiced, is to keep the
    ground around the trees continually covered with a
    mulch of leaves or other coarse vegetable matter.</p>
<p><strong>Planting and Pruning.</strong>&mdash;The space to be allowed
    between the plants, when set out for bearing, will, of
    course, depend very much upon the size they are expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> to attain. Those varieties which assume and
    remain in the bush form may be planted very close together,
    or not more than six to eight feet between the
    plants; but those which become small trees must be
    given more room. The larger European sorts, which
    are at present the only ones worth cultivating for their
    nuts, should be set ten or twelve feet apart, and the
    rows fifteen to sixteen feet, then if properly pruned they
    will shade the ground and be in a convenient form for
    gathering the crop. The trees may be planted in the
    orchard when quite small, and some kind of vegetable
    crop grown among them for the first two or three years,
    but I would prefer keeping the plants in nursery rows
    until they were four or five feet high, and then transplant
    to the orchard, and set a short, stout stake by the
    side of each, to keep the main stem in an upright position
    until the tree is well established.</p>
<p>The first pruning,&mdash;except removing suckers from
    those in the nursery rows,&mdash;will be the heading back of
    the main or central stem to a hight of two or three
    feet, for the purpose of laying the foundation, as it
    were, of the head of the future tree. Three or four of
    the larger branches, which will push out from near the
    top of the severed main stem, are to be selected to form
    the top, and all others removed. Small lateral branches
    or twigs will spring out from the larger or main ones,
    and in this way the head of a bearing tree is formed.
    But before attempting to prune a mature or fruitful
    tree, we must consider the mode of fructification, for
    the filbert does not bear nuts on the young growth of
    the season, as in the chestnut, but on the small branchlets
    or spur-like twigs of the preceding season, or, as we
    may say, on the one-year-old twigs. The small fruiting
    twigs are seldom more than four to six inches long, and
    sometimes almost every well-developed bud on these contain
    pistillate flowers and embryo nuts, either singly or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> in clusters. In pruning the bearing trees, the main
    point to be observed is to head back the strong leading
    shoots, to prevent the trees growing too tall, as well as
    to force out the side or lateral twigs as fruiting wood
    for the ensuing year. If the heads of the trees become
    too much crowded to admit light and air to the center,
    some of the larger branches must be removed entire.
    The best time to prune is in early spring, when the trees
    are in bloom, for at this season we can readily determine
    the injured from the sound male catkins, and preserve
    enough of these to insure perfect fertilization. It is not
    necessary, however, that there should be healthy pollen-bearing
    catkins on every tree in an orchard, for if one in
    a dozen is well supplied, there will be sufficient to fertilize
    the flowers of all growing near by. It often happens,
    in our rather severe climate, that the catkins of
    some trees or varieties are winterkilled, while the pistillate
    flowers enclosed in the buds escape injury, and
    when this occurs it is well to have some hardy variety at
    hand, from which pollen can be obtained when needed.
    The inferior varieties are usually the most hardy, and
    the wild European hazel or our northern beaked hazel,
    will usually escape injury where all the large improved
    sorts fail, and it requires but a few minutes' labor to cut
    branches bearing sound catkins, and scatter these about
    through the heads of trees requiring such assistance to
    make them fruitful.</p>
<h2>SPECIES OF AMERICAN HAZELS.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Corylus Americana</span> (Walters). Common hazel
    bush.&mdash;Leaves roundish, heart-shaped, pointed, coarsely
    serrate; husk somewhat downy, with a wide, flattened,
    fringed border extending beyond the roundish nut.
    Shell rather thick and brittle; kernel sweet and good,
    but the nut is too small to be considered of much value.
    A low shrub, with many stems springing from the roots.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> Young shoots and twigs downy and glandular-hairy.
    Common in woods and old fields from Canada to Florida.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Corylus Rostrata</span> (Aiton). Beaked hazel.&mdash;Leaves
    ovate or oblong, somewhat heart-shaped, pointed, doubly
    serrate; husk extending an inch or more beyond the
    round or ovoid nut, forming before it opens a long tubular
    beak, hence the name. The husk is densely covered
    with nettle-like bristles, which are quite irritating to
    tender hands. The nuts are small, usually growing in
    clusters at the ends of the twigs, only a few coming to
    maturity. A low shrub or small tree, usually growing
    in a dense clump, not spreading from subterranean
    stems, as in the last species. Common on rather firm
    and rich soil along the borders of streams, in the
    northern border States, and southward on the Alleghanies,
    but most abundant in the north through Canada,
    and westward to the Pacific in Washington and
    Oregon, where, in the mountains, it often assumes the
    tree form, growing to a hight of twenty-five to thirty
    feet, with a stem from four to six inches in diameter.
    The wood is light, soft, and very white to the center.
    It also extends southward to central California, but
    here it is only a small bush, this form having been described
    under the name of <i>Corylus rostrata</i>, var. Californica,
    A. de C. This species probably reaches its highest
    development in the Cascade range, in northern Oregon.
    The same or a closely allied species of the hazel
    extends far into northern Asia. There are no improved
    varieties of either of our native species of the hazel in
    cultivation.</p>
<h2>EUROPEAN SPECIES OF CORYLUS.</h2>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/fig39.jpg" alt="" height="665" width="500" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._39" id="FIG._39">FIG. 39</a>. CONSTANTINOPLE HAZEL.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Corylus Avellana</span> (Linn.). Common hazelnut.&mdash;Leaves
    roundish, heart-shaped, pointed, coarsely and unevenly
    serrate; husk bell-shaped, spreading, with a
    fringed or deeply cut margin. The original form of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> nut is supposed to have been ovate or oval, but with a
    plant indigenous to such a wide range of climate and
    country, and one that has been so long under cultivation,&mdash;running
    wild in many localities where it is not a native,&mdash;it
    would be very difficult at this time to determine its
    primary botanical characters. A common shrub or small
    tree throughout the greater part of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Corylus Colurna</span> (Linn.).&mdash;Constantinople hazel.
    Leaves roundish ovate, heart-shaped; husk double,
    the inner one divided into three deeply cleft divisions,
    the outer with many long, slender, curved segments,
    giving to the calyx or husk a fringed appearance, but
    leaving the end of the nut fully exposed (Fig. 39). Nuts
    small, and for this reason rarely cultivated. Native of
    Asia Minor, where the tree attains a hight of from fifty
    to sixty feet. It is, however, hardy in France and England,
    and was introduced into the latter country some
    three hundred years ago, probably by Clusius, who received
    either nuts or plants from Constantinople, hence
    its present name.</p>
<p>There are several other hazels and filberts, so distinct
    from the two common European types that botanists
    have, in a few instances, been inclined to elevate them
    to the rank of species, and among these I may name <i>Corylus heterophylla</i>, or various-leaved filbert, from eastern
    Asia, also the <i>Corylus ferox</i>, or spiny filbert, which
    has a long and deeply cut or fringed husk. It is a native
    of the Sheopur mountain in Nepaul. But from the
    two common European species, <i>C. Avellana</i> and <i>C. Colurna</i>,
    and their hybrids, many hundreds of varieties
    have been raised, and from among these we may readily
    select a dozen possessing all the distinct and estimable
    properties to be found in this genus of nut-bearing
    plants; to multiply names without securing anything
    of intrinsic value, is but a waste of time and labor on
    the part of the cultivator.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>As we have no popular varieties of American origin,
    I am compelled to consult European catalogues in making
    a selection of those most promising for cultivation
    here, and this is, perhaps, an advantage, inasmuch as
    our transatlantic cousins have had a long experience and
    abundant opportunities for determining the merits of
    the varieties they recommend. If hardiness and adaptation
    to our soil and climate are to be taken into account,
    in making a selection, then we may fail for the
    want of experienced guides, as it is undeniable that very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span> few persons in this country have ever attempted to conduct
    extended experiments in the cultivation of either
    the native or European species and varieties of the hazel.</p>
<p>Taking this view of the situation, I shall avail myself
    of the small but select list of varieties given in that
    standard work, &quot;The Dictionary of Gardening,&quot; edited
    by Mr. George Nicholson, of the Royal Gardens, Kew,
    England.</p>
<h2>SELECT LIST OF VARIETIES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Alba, or White filbert.</span>&mdash;Considered in England
    one of the best varieties in cultivation. From the
    peculiar structure of the husk, which contracts rather
    than opens at the outer edge, this filbert can be kept
    longer in its cover than most others. As fashion
    demands that fresh filberts must be brought to the
    table in their husks, this variety deserves special attention.
    It is also known as Avelinier Blanche, Wrotham
    Park, etc.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cosford, or Miss Young's Thin-Shelled.</span>&mdash;Nut
    oblong, of excellent quality; husk hairy, deeply
    cut, about as long as the nut. Highly valued on account
    of the thinness of the shell.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Crispa, or Frizzled Filbert.</span>&mdash;Shell thin, somewhat
    flattened; husk richly and curiously frizzled
    throughout, open wide at the mouth, and hanging
    about as long again as the nut. Ripens late, and one of
    the most productive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Downton Large Square.</span>&mdash;Nut very large; shell
    thick and well-filled; husk smooth, shorter than the
    nut. A peculiarly formed semi-square nut, of the best
    quality.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lambert's Filbert</span> (<i>Corylus tubulosa</i>).&mdash;Nut
    large, oblong; shell thick and strong, the kernel being
    covered with a red skin; husk long, rather smooth, serrated
    at the edges, longer than the nut. A fine, strong-growing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> free-fruiting variety. It is quite popular in
    California, where it has been in cultivation for twenty
    years or more under the name of Red Aveline. Specimens
    I have received from there were not as large as
    those raised in England, but this can be accounted for
    by the difference in climate. This variety is cultivated
    in Europe under various local names, as, for instance,
    Great Cob, Kentish Cob, Filbert Cob, and Large Bond
    Cob.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grandis, or Round cob-nut.</span>&mdash;Nut large, short,
    slightly compressed, very thick and hard; husk shorter
    than the fruit, much frizzled and hairy. This is supposed
    to be the true Barcelona nut of commerce, and is
    one of the finest grown. This is the large round hazel
    or filbert so largely imported for the trade in this country.
    It has many synonyms, and among them we may
    record Downton, Dwarf Prolific, Great Cob and Round
    Cob.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Purple-Leaved filbert.</span>&mdash;Usually cultivated as
    an ornamental shrub in this country, but under proper
    treatment it is one of the most valuable for its fruit.
    Leaves very large, and of a deep purple color. Nuts
    and husk of the same color, which they retain until cut
    by frosts. Nuts large, an inch in length; husks much
    longer than the nut, and slightly hairy. The catkins
    are tender and become winterkilled in our Northern
    States, but if the pistillate flowers are fertilized by pollen
    from some more hardy plant, this purple-leaved
    filbert is exceedingly prolific. I have gathered eighty
    nuts from a small bush in my garden, the flowers of
    which had been fertilized from another variety in early
    spring.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Red filbert.</span> Red Hazel, Avelinier Rouge.&mdash;Nut
    medium ovate, not long as in the <i>tubulosa</i>, or Lambert's
    filbert; shell thick; husk long and hispid. A very
    productive variety of good quality.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Spanish filbert.</span>&mdash;Nut very large, oblong; shell
    thick; husk smooth, longer than the nut. A very large
    variety, sometimes confounded with the Round cob-nut
    and its synonyms.</p>
<h2>PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH FILBERTS.</h2>
<p>Believing that our failures are often of far more
    value, in the line of education, than our successes, I
    shall not hesitate to place my own on record as guideposts
    to those who may be seeking the most direct road
    to success in nut culture. Having had a rather extended
    and expensive experience in the cultivation of filberts, I
    propose giving a brief account of it here, with the hope
    that it may save some other enthusiast from losing time
    and money.</p>
<p>My attention was first specially drawn to these nuts
    in 1858,&mdash;while a resident of the city of Brooklyn, N. Y.,&mdash;by
    a neighbor who had a moderately large garden, on
    three sides of which he had planted a row of English
    filberts. These trees, at the time, had attained a hight
    of about fifteen feet, with broad, open heads, and they
    rarely failed to produce a heavy crop of nuts, which sold
    readily at very remunerative prices, for as they were
    always gathered in the husks and sold by the pound,
    the amount obtained from these few trees seemed to be
    enormous, considering the small space they occupied in
    this garden. The owner of these filbert trees, being an
    Englishman by birth, never tired of showing his English
    filberts to visitors, and of descanting upon their value,
    as well as upon the stupid indifference of the Yankees
    in neglecting the cultivation of these valuable nuts. I
    imbibed enough of my neighbor's enthusiasm to secure
    a good stock of his plants, a few years later, for cultivation
    in my grounds here. The third year after planting,
    quite a number of the bushes produced a fair crop of
    nuts, but I noticed that an occasional shoot was affected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> with blight, and these were immediately cut out and
    burned. The next season more of the branches were
    affected, and from these the blight extended downward
    on the main stems, and when these were cut away the
    sprouts from below made a very vigorous and apparently
    healthy growth, some reaching a hight of six feet the
    first season, but a year or two later these were also attacked
    and destroyed by blight.</p>
<p>Finding that the filberts in my grounds were doomed,
    I visited my old neighbor in Brooklyn, hoping to learn
    something of the origin or cause of the disease; but the
    blight had invaded his garden, and not a tree remained.
    On my return from this visit I had every filbert and
    hazel plant on my place dug up and burned, thinking
    by such means to stamp out the disease. After waiting
    ten years, I thought it time to try filberts again, and to
    be certain of securing pure and healthy plants, I concluded
    to raise them from the nuts, and sent an order
    for a few pounds of the largest and best variety to be
    found in the celebrated filbert orchards of Kent, Eng.
    In due time the nuts arrived, and they were very large,
    and all of one variety, as ordered. They were mixed
    with sand and buried in the garden until the following
    spring, then sown thinly in shallow drills and covered
    with about two inches of rich soil.</p>

<p>At the close of the first season the plants were from
    one to two feet high and quite stocky, with a mass of
    small fibrous roots. The next spring they were transplanted
    into nursery rows, and set about one foot apart.
    The third spring I laid out about one acre for a specimen
    filbert orchard, and after the ground had been thoroughly
    prepared, the plants were set ten feet apart in
    the row, and twelve between the rows. No crop was
    planted among the trees, but the ground was kept clean
    and free from weeds during the summer, with cultivator
    and harrow. All suckers springing from the base of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> stems were removed as soon as they appeared, and under
    such treatment the plants made a vigorous growth. Two
    years later quite a number of the trees came into bearing,
    these showing that I was likely to have nearly as
    many varieties in my orchard as there were trees. Some
    of the varieties might be better than the parent, but the
    greater part were certain to be inferior in size. The
    fourth year after planting in the orchard the trees gave
    me a heavy crop of nuts, and they made a fine appearance
    as one looked down between the long rows, as
    shown in Fig. 40. But this season my old enemy, the
    filbert blight, appeared again, and branches and main
    stems began to blacken and the leaves to wither. But I
    had bushels of nuts and in great variety, and by sending
    specimen baskets of the long-husk varieties to dealers
    in New York, learned that there was an almost
    unlimited demand for such nuts, at prices ranging from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> thirty to seventy-five cents per pound, if sent to market
    in their fresh, half-ripened husk; but later on, when
    the nuts have fallen out and become thoroughly ripened,
    as when imported, ten cents a pound may be considered
    an average price for the larger varieties. Several of
    these are shown in Fig. 41, of natural size and form.
    Another extra-large hazel is shown in Fig. 42. The
    fifth year after planting, my specimen filbert orchard
    had suffered so much from blight that it appeared as
    shown in Fig. 43; but a few dozen trees have been reserved,
    the rest being removed and reduced to ashes.</p>

<p><strong>Name and Nature of the Filbert Blight.</strong>&mdash;The
    reader must not suppose that one who has spent as much
    time and money as the writer in experimenting with
    these nuts, would make no effort to discover the origin
    and name of such a virulent disease, and means of destroying
    it if these were known. For many years I had
    been well aware of its presence in nearly all of the nurseries
    of the older States, as well as in the public parks
    and private gardens. In the meantime I had diligently
    examined the reports of the Division of Vegetable Pathology
    of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, as well
    as the hundreds of bulletins of the various State experiment
    stations, treating of the fungous diseases of plants,
    all without finding a hint or reference to this widely
    distributed and destructive blight of the filbert. I also
    sent many specimens of the diseased twigs and branches
    to professional mycologists, with no better results.
    With the nature of the disease, its mode of multiplication
    and distribution, I had become somewhat familiar,
    but the information sought was: Had it ever
    been described and given a scientific name, and if so,
    where, and by whom? This much of its history had
    somehow escaped me, and, as it would appear from the
    following correspondence, the chances were none too
    good of finding it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>In reply to an inquiry directed to the U. S. Department

    2, relating to the disease of the filbert,
    is at hand. In reply I have to say that we have not investigated
    this trouble, and are therefore unable to furnish you

    as you describe it, have never been, so far as I know, referred
    to the Division, nor am I able to find any record of any

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>On the receipt of this note of Prof. Woods, I looked
    up Ellis and Everhart's work, a voluminous one of over
    800 octavo pages, published by the authors at Newfield,
    N. J. This filbert blight is briefly described under the
    scientific name of <i>Cryptospora anomala</i>, Pk., but Prof.
    Peck writes me that &quot;the description was made from
    specimens discovered near Albany, N. Y., in May, 1874.
    In 1882 this description was republished by Saccardo, in
    his &quot;Syllage Fungorum,&quot; Vol. I, p. 470, under the name
    of <i>Cryptosporella anomala</i>. The original name in Report
    28, p. 72, was <i>Diatrype anomala</i>. In 1892 Ellis and
    Everhart, in &quot;Pyrenomycetes of North America,&quot; p. 531,
    changed the name again, making it <i>Cryptospora anomala</i>.&quot;
    So at present we have the names of this fungus
    in the following order:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><i>Diatrypes anomal</i>, Peck, 1876.<br />
        <i>Cryptosporella anomala</i>, Sacc., 1882.<br />
        <i>Cryptospora anomala</i>, E. and E., 1892.<br />
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ellis and Everhart, after giving scientific description,
    add,</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;On living stems of <i>Corylus Americana</i>,
        Albany, N. Y. (Peck), Iowa (Holoway), on <i>Corylus Avellana</i>,
        Newfield, N. J. The pustules appear first on
        the smaller branches, and are serrately arranged along
        one side of the branch; afterwards they appear also on
        the larger branches and on the trunk itself, and in the
        course of two or three years the part of tree above
        ground is entirely killed. The roots, however, still
        retain their vitality, and continue to send up each year
        a luxuriant growth of new shoots, destined to be destroyed
        the succeeding year by the inexorable pest. The
        imported trees seem to be more injuriously affected than
        the native species.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The observations of Ellis and Everhart and Prof.
    Woods accord with my own, but I may say that the infested
    branches often show the presence of the mycelium
    in the bark and alburnum,&mdash;by a slight shrinking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>&mdash;
    weeks or months before the pustules appear, for these
    are merely indications of the last stage in the life of the
    fungus, and with the throwing off the spores from these
    pustules the old parasite perishes.</p>
<p>The pustules, when fully open, are from one-sixteenth
    to one-eighth of an inch in diameter,
    usually round, but sometimes slightly
    oval in form, and placed mainly in almost
    straight rows lengthways of the branch, as
    shown in Fig. 44. These pustules appear
    on wood of all ages, from two years upward,
    and in what may be termed patches, ranging
    from a few inches to a foot or more in
    length, and more frequently on the upper
    side than the underside of the branches.</p>

    HAZEL FUNGUS.</span> </div>
<p>This fungus is undoubtedly indigenous,
    and its host plant is the common
    American hazel (<i>C. Americana</i>). From a
    very careful search, I have not been able to
    find any clump of these bushes of any considerable
    size that was entirely free from
    pustulous stems. But on these wild plants
    it seems to do but little harm, for if a stem
    is killed, another soon springs up from the
    roots to take its place; but when this fungus
    invades our orchards and gardens and
    attacks filbert trees, we recognize it as an
    implacable enemy. How far the spores of
    this fungus are likely to be carried by the
    wind, transported on the clothes of a person,
    or the hair of domestic animals, I do
    not know, but it certainly is not safe to
    plant the susceptible species and varieties
    within a mile of the wild hazel bushes, unless the planter
    is prepared to use fungicides freely on his trees. There
    are certain phases of this filbert blight that are rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> obscure and scarcely explainable; as, for instance, its
    virulence among some species and varieties, and almost
    if not total absence among others. So far as my observation
    extends, I have never found it attacking the native
    beaked hazel (<i>Corylus rostrata</i>), and my correspondents
    in the Northwest and in the Pacific States assure
    me that no blight on the hazel has, as yet, been found
    there, and its absence is probably due to the fact that
    the common hazel (<i>C. Americana</i>) is not an inhabitant
    of these regions.</p>
<p>In a neighbor's garden just across the highway from
    my own, there are, at this time, four old European
    hazelnut trees, fully twenty feet high and as many years
    old. They are of two varieties: one a small round nut,
    the other a long, slender nut, but neither of much value,
    because of their small size. The trees, however, are
    perfectly healthy, never having suffered from the blight,
    although these four are all that remain of a long row
    of choice European varieties all planted at the same
    time. Blight destroyed the better varieties, while these
    inferior ones continue to thrive and are exceedingly
    productive.</p>
<p>This native fungus that causes blight in the hazels
    is but one of a large number of similar maladies which
    have appeared and often worsted the horticulturist, in
    his endeavor to introduce and cultivate foreign species
    and varieties of plants, and like the tropical fevers, they
    may pass unnoticed among the natives, but are terribly
    fatal to immigrants from cooler climates. The disease
    so well known as the black knot (<i>Otthia morbosa</i>, Schu.),
    and widely destructive to the European varieties of the
    plum, and Morello cherries, has existed for ages among
    our native plums and black cherries, doing comparatively
    little harm; but it seems to protest, by its virulence,
    against the introduction of some foreign species.
    The same is true with various blights and rusts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> attack the exotic pear, apple, quince, peach, and other
    of the larger fruits, and we have only to ascend the
    scale a few degrees from the microscopic fungi to the
    microscopic insects, to meet on the very threshold of
    this realm the minute but unconquerable grape louse
    (<i>Phylloxera vastatrix</i>), which for more than two centuries
    has prevented the successful cultivation of the European
    varieties of the grape in the open air everywhere
    east of the Rocky mountains in North America; although
    this minute insect has ever been present and a constant
    parasite of the indigenous species of the grape, but
    scarcely affecting the health of its host. The plum curculio,
    chestnut and hickory weevils, bean weevil, and
    many other similar species of insects appear to be ever
    protesting against the introduction of exotic plants, as
    well as the improvement of our indigenous kinds.</p>
<p>It is this blight, and nothing else, that has prevented
    the extensive cultivation of the improved varieties
    of the European filbert and hazelnut in this country,
    and not the uncongenial soil and climate, as has
    been so often &quot;officially&quot; proclaimed by men whose theories
    are far greater than their practical knowledge of
    such subjects. Men whose experience with these nuts
    has been limited to a few isolated bushes or trees in gardens
    or nurseries, where they were protected, or beyond
    the reach of the spores of the blight fungus, as has
    already been noted in the experience of Prince, Downing,
    Barry, and my neighbor Butler, of Brooklyn, could
    scarcely understand why others should remain so indifferent
    to such a promising industry, or why the demand
    for the trees remained so limited, with scarcely an
    attempt to plant filbert orchards anywhere in this country.
    Nurserymen have continued to offer the choice
    varieties at low prices per plant, and to advise their customers
    to cultivate filberts extensively, even to setting
    them in hedgerows; and yet home-grown filberts remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> as rare in our markets as they were a hundred years ago,
    and all due to the simple reason that the insidious filbert
    blight still scatters its spores unrestrained.</p>
<p>With the present almost universal employment of
    various fungicides for the destruction of blights, mildews
    and rusts on cultivated fruits and vegetables, we
    may confidently assert that the diseases of the filbert
    may be readily controlled by the same means. The
    spraying of the trees with Bordeaux mixture and other
    copper solutions will certainly destroy the fungus spores,
    and with these out of the way filbert culture may become
    of as much importance and as popular here as it is
    in certain countries of Europe. In my own experience
    I have found no other nut tree (barring always the
    blight) that has been more satisfactory. The plants
    come forward rapidly, fruiting freely and abundantly
    when young, and if properly trained, the crop can be
    gathered with little labor, and as it is ready for use a
    month or more in advance of the arrival of fresh nuts
    from abroad, the home market during the time is at our
    command.</p>
<p>The number of applications of the fungicides that
    will be necessary during the season to rid the trees of
    blight, or the strength of the copper solution used, will
    depend somewhat upon circumstances and the condition
    of the subjects operated upon. If the trees are growing
    near hedges of wild hazels, where there is a constant or
    annual influx of the fungus spores, then greater care
    will be required to suppress them than if the trees are
    some distance from such sources of contagion; and it
    may be well for those contemplating planting filbert
    orchards, to examine their surroundings carefully in advance,
    in order to avoid local blight-breeding plants,
    and have these destroyed if any are found. I would also
    warn the cultivator against collecting branches of the
    wild hazel in the spring, carrying pollen-bearing catkins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span> to be employed in fertilizing the pistillate flowers of the
    cultivated varieties, for by such means blight spores may
    be readily introduced into orchard and garden.</p>
<p>It will seldom be necessary to practice artificial fertilization,
    where any considerable number of trees are
    grown near together, because if ninety per cent. of the
    male catkins are winterkilled, the few remaining will be
    sufficient to supply pollen for the pistillate flowers.
    In my grounds filberts have never failed to produce annual
    crops after reaching a bearing age, although they
    have been subjected to great extremes of temperature in
    winter. One year the trees were in full bloom the last
    week in February, and although cold weather followed,
    the protected pistillate flowers were not injured. The
    winters of 1894 and 1895 were among the severest,
    in the way of continuous low temperature, I have ever
    experienced here, and while the filberts did not bloom
    until the first week in April, the crop proved to be
    abundant.</p>
<p><strong>Insects Injurious to Filberts.</strong>&mdash;My personal observations
    lead me to believe that the filberts and hazels
    are, in this country, remarkably free from the depredations
    of noxious insects. Two species of nut weevils
    have been reported as breeding in the wild hazelnuts,
    viz., <i>Balaninus obtusus</i>, and <i>B. nasicus</i>, but among
    the many bushels of the European varieties of the filbert
    produced in my grounds I have never found one infested
    by a weevil or other insect. In Europe a nut weevil
    (<i>B. nucum</i>) is said to be very destructive to the wild
    hazel, often invading the filbert orchards, and this
    we can readily believe, because they are not at all uncommon
    in the imported nuts, but fortunately have not,
    as yet, become naturalized in this country.</p>
<p>The great hazel-leaf beetle, or as more generally
    known, elm-leaf beetle (<i>Monocesta coryli</i>), has been
    known in a few instances to attack and defoliate large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> patches of the wild hazel bushes, but this insect seems
    to prefer the elm, hence is rarely found on the hazels.
    But should it ever invade our filbert orchards, it can be
    readily destroyed by dusting or spraying the trees with
    Paris green, London purple, or other well-known insecticides.
    There may be an occasional invasion of caterpillars,
    like the tent worms, spanworms, leaf rollers of
    various species, and what are called leaf miners, but as
    these infest almost all kinds of deciduous trees and
    shrubs, we cannot consider them specially injurious to
    the filberts and hazels.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>HICKORY NUTS.</h3>
<p>Hicoria, <i>Rafinesque</i>. Name probably derived from
    the aboriginal or Indian word hickery, or hickory, the
    common name for these nuts among the tribes formerly
    inhabiting the Middle and Southern Atlantic States.</p>
<p><strong>Order</strong>, <i>Juglandaceæ</i> (Walnut family).&mdash;Native deciduous
    trees of large size, with compound serrate leaves
    with an odd number of leaflets, varying from five to fifteen
    in the different species, the three terminal ones
    usually much the largest, the lower ones on opposite
    sides of the rather stout leafstalk. Male catkins slender,
    cylindrical, pendulous, two to six inches long, three
    in a cluster, on a naked peduncle or stalk (Fig. 46)
    springing from the base of the terminal buds of the previous
    season's twigs, and just below the first set of new
    leaves in spring; calyx unequally three-parted; stamens
    three to eight. Female flowers two or more in a cluster,
    from the end of the new growth of the season, which
    becomes the common peduncle or fruit-stalk of a single
    nut or cluster of nuts. The flowers are destitute of
    petals; stigma short, broad, and four-lobed; husk fleshy
    or leathery, smooth, very thick in some species and
    thin in others, partly or wholly four-lobed, opening in
    some, allowing the nut to drop out at maturity, in others
    adhering, falling off entire when ripe. Nuts with hard,
    bone-like shell, round or oblong, smooth or deeply four
    to six angled, somewhat flattened or compressed in most
    of the species; kernel two-lobed, oily, sweet and delicious,
    as in the common shellbark hickory, or extremely
    bitter, as in the bitter nut.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p><strong>History.</strong>&mdash;The early white settlers of the Atlantic
    States found the hickory nut in common use among the
    Indians, who gathered and stored them in large quantities
    in the fall, for food during the winter months, and
    while our ancestors who sought to make homes in the
    western wilderness may have appreciated these luxuries,
    they needed land for cultivation, and to secure it the
    forests were destroyed, with no thought of preserving
    trees that would yield food for themselves or succeeding
    generations. Not only were the forests cleared away, as
    things to be banished from sight and mind, but as the
    hickories yielded superior timber for various agricultural
    and other implements, as well as for fuel, they were
    often sought for and utilized in advance of the general
    clearing of wood lands, and the first to feel the woodman's
    axe.</p>
<p>William Bartram, in the account of his travels
    through the Southern Atlantic States, from 1773 to
    1778, and published in Philadelphia in 1791, says, in
    referring to these nuts, that they are held &quot;in great
    estimation with the present generation of Indians, particularly <i>Juglans exaltata</i>, commonly called shellbarked
    hickory; the Creeks store up the latter in their towns.
    I have seen above an hundred bushels of these nuts belonging
    to one family. They pound them to pieces, and
    then cast them into boiling water, which, after passing
    through fine strainers, preserves the most oily part of
    the liquid; this they call by a name which signifies
    'hickory milk;' it is as sweet and rich as fresh cream,
    and is an ingredient in most of their cookery, especially
    in hominy and corn cakes.&quot;</p>
<p>We can readily imagine what a delicious liquid
    hickory milk must be in which to cook hominy, rice,
    and similar kinds of grain; and there would be no danger
    from tuberculosis in this natural product of the vegetable
    kingdom. Perhaps at some future day, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> milch cows are as rare in this country as they have been
    for ages in China and Japan, hickory milk will come
    into vogue again and be more highly valued by our people
    than it ever was by the aborigines.</p>
<p>While we have no romantic tales to repeat in which
    either hickory trees or the nuts have played an important
    part, yet we can well imagine that such delicious food
    must, in ages past, as well as in our own times, have
    been a coveted luxury, enjoyed at many a social gathering
    of friends and neighbors. Many a country boy and girl
    has welcomed the early autumn frosts, because they announced
    the opening of the nutting season, reminding
    them of the long winter evenings near at hand, and that
    the industrious and nimble squirrel was a sharp competitor
    in the nutting field; consequently, no time could
    be wasted if a store of such luxuries was to be gathered
    for home use, or to be sent to city or village market for
    the benefit of less fortunate consumers. It is to be
    hoped that this source of pleasure and profit may continue
    long after the original forests of our country have
    disappeared, and through the preservation and planting
    of the noble food-bearing hickories by the roadsides, in
    orchards, also for shelter, shade and ornament. Valuable
    as hickory timber and hickory nuts have always been
    to the inhabitants of this country, we might reasonably
    suppose that there would be many thousands of these
    trees planted every year, in order to keep up a supply
    and make good the annual loss sustained in the destruction
    constantly going on in our forests. But no such
    plantings appear to have been undertaken in our Northern
    States, and only quite recently in the Southern,
    where the pecan nut is attracting considerable attention,
    on account of the increase in demand, and the advance in
    price obtained for them in the markets. Furthermore,
    with the many millions of dollars expended by the general
    government to encourage the planting, preservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> and cultivation of forest trees, no special encouragement
    has been extended to the nut-bearing kinds, and the
    man who plants a cottonwood or worthless willow is
    given as much credit as though he planted and reared a
    tree a thousand times more valuable to himself and the
    country at large.</p>
<p>This may not be a very creditable phase of nut culture
    in the United States, but it is history, nevertheless,
    and to attempt to suppress it would merely be encouraging
    negligence, which has already become so general
    that the inferior varieties of hickory nuts command a
    much higher price in our markets than the very choicest
    did a few years ago.</p>
<p>The nomenclature of the walnut family has been
    subjected to various revisions by botanists, during the
    present century, and there are probably others yet to
    follow in the near or distant future. In all other standard
    botanical works published prior to 1817-1818, the
    hickories were classed with the butternut, black walnut
    and Persian walnut, and under the generic name of <i>Juglans</i>. But in the year 1818 Mr. Thomas Nuttall, an
    eminent English botanist, who had given years to wandering
    through our forests and studying American
    plants, separated the hickories from the older genus of <i>Juglans</i>, placing them in a new one, to which he gave
    the name of <i>Carya</i>, from an ancient Greek name of the
    walnut tree. This classification of Nuttall's was immediately
    adopted by the botanists of his time, and has
    been observed, scarcely without question, by the authors
    of all the numerous botanical works published in America
    and Europe during the past seventy-five years. But
    now we are informed by some of our noted botanists
    that, in deference to the law of priority dominant in
    matters scientific, Nuttall's name for this genus must
    be abandoned, inasmuch as Mr. C. S. Rafinesque,
    an erratic Frenchman possessing considerable ability<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> for botanical research, and who came to this country
    several years before Nuttall,&mdash;as some recent investigations
    appear to prove,&mdash;defined the distinct characteristics
    of the hickories, and not only proposed, but published
    the name <i>Hicoria</i> for this genus in 1817, while
    Nuttall's <i>Carya</i> did not appear until one year later, viz.:
    1818. For these dates I am mainly indebted to Dr. N.
    L. Britton, who appears to have been delving among
    &quot;first editions&quot; of the works of the authors named
    (Bulletin, Torrey Botanical Club, 1888).</p>
<p>It seems strange, however, at this late date, that
    such eminent botanists as the late Dr. John Torrey and
    Dr. Asa Gray, who were both intimately acquainted
    with, in fact associates of, Rafinesque, should have ignored
    his rights in regard to the name of <i>Hicoria</i>, if he
    was really entitled to the honor of founding this genus
    and separating the hickories from the <i>Juglans</i>. But for
    some good reason they left the matter in abeyance, for
    their successors to settle. Dr. Torrey does, in a way,
    recognize Rafinesque, in his &quot;Catalogue of Plants Within
    Thirty Miles of the City of New York,&quot; published in
    1819, but in a manner which shows that he had no confidence
    in Rafinesque's claim, but did approve of Nuttall's
    classifications and name of <i>Carya</i>, for on page 74
    he refers to the hickories as follows: &quot;<i>Carya</i>, Nuttall; <i>Hickoria</i>, Rafinesque.&quot;</p>
<p>From this it appears that Dr. Torrey did not adopt <i>Hicoria</i> as the proper mode of spelling this word, but
    retained the letter k in giving it a Latin form. This is
    not strange, inasmuch as Rafinesque had no settled form
    of his own, and varied the spelling at different times;
    as, for instance, <i>Scoria</i>, <i>Hicoria</i>, <i>Hickorius</i> and <i>Hicorius</i>.
    It is but reasonable to suppose that Dr. Torrey
    was familiar with Rafinesque's earlier writings, and also
    whether his proposed generic name of <i>Scoria</i>, in 1808,
    was legitimate, or a misspelling of <i>Hicoria</i>, as suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> by Dr. Britton. But of one thing we may rest assured,
    and that is, Dr. Torrey would not knowingly detract
    from, nor fail to give every man full credit for his labors
    in any branch of natural history or elsewhere, and he
    certainly must have known Rafinesque in all his eccentricities
    and moods, for when in New York city he was
    usually the guest of Dr. Torrey, and these relations continued
    for many years.</p>
<p>A few of our leading botanists, having recently decided
    that Rafinesque's name of <i>Hicoria</i> must be restored,
    in deference to the laws of priority, and Nuttall's <i>Carya</i> be relegated to the position of a synonym, I have
    concluded to adopt it in this work, although I am well
    aware that a large majority of our botanists have protested
    against this change, probably because of the confusion
    it is likely to cause in the botanical literature of
    our times. My own reason for adopting <i>Hicoria</i> is not
    so much from any special reverence to the laws of priority,
    but because it is derived from an old American Indian
    name, and for all such I have a profound regard,
    and would retain and adopt them whenever and wherever
    they are at all appropriate to products indigenous
    to this country. The hickories being purely American,
    and unknown to Greece or Greeks, a semi-native name
    is all the more acceptable. It is not to be expected that
    botanical quibbles are of any special interest to the practical
    nut culturist, for a pecan or a shellbark hickory
    will taste just as sweet and command as high a price in
    market under one scientific name as another; but the
    cultivator may have occasion to look up the botanical
    name of his trees in some school botany, or other botanical
    work, and fail to find it, in the absence of some guide
    to the various changes that have been made in the name
    of the genus, as well as in the name of the synonyms of
    the different species. Then, again, propagators and
    dealers in trees are prone to employ unfamiliar names,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> whether they are old or new, this adding to the confusion,
    without benefit to either purchaser or cultivator.</p>
<p>To assist those who may have occasion to consult
    these pages for either the common or botanical names of
    the different species of the hickory, I shall endeavor to
    give the greater part of those compiled by Prof. C. S.
    Sargent (Tenth Census), Dr. Britton, and other eminent
    authorities whose works I have had occasion to
    consult in writing this treatise. It is not certain, however,
    that these revisions and readjustments of the scientific
    names of this genus of trees will remain undisturbed
    for any considerable number of years, for we
    have &quot;many men of many minds&quot; at work in the line
    of botanical research, and it can scarcely be expected
    that all will reach the same conclusion, either in fact or
    fancy; besides, it is often difficult, if not wholly impossible,
    to determine a species from the description given
    by the earlier botanists, for they are generally very brief
    and vague, and will often apply equally well to two or
    more species of the same genus. In some instances not
    a word is given in the way of description, merely a
    name, as in &quot;Bartram's Travels&quot; (1791), where he speaks
    of <i>Juglans exaltata</i>, a tall-growing hickory found in the
    region through which he was traveling, and we now
    know that it may have been any one of two or three species
    indigenous to the Southern States.</p>
<p>Under such confusing circumstances I shall make
    no claim of infallibility in applying names to species,
    but attempt no more than my predecessors have in the
    same direction, and my contemporaries are now attempting,
    i. e., make as close a guess as possible as to the species
    or variety of hickory which the earlier authors intended
    to name and briefly describe. The date of publication
    of some of the earlier works consulted are given,
    as an earnest of my desire to assent to the law of priority
    in such matters.</p>

<p>Although Clayton, as with most of the earlier botanists,
    fails to give any description of the foliage of the
    hickories he mentions, and all have the affix <i>alba</i> (white),
    yet his reference to the form of the nut and the scaly
    bark of the tree is sufficient to enable us to identify the
    species as that of our common shellbark hickory of the
    Atlantic States, which extends through the regions
    where he gathered his botanical specimens.</p>

    from the shell when cracked. The very large size of
    these nuts makes them a favorite, especially where the
    pecan and the true shellbarks are
    not plentiful. These nuts were
    formerly known as the Springfield
    or Gloucester nut. A very large

    Elliott, in &quot;Botany of South Carolina and
    Georgia&quot; (1824), says it is rare in the low country
    of Carolina, but he does not say that it is found plentiful
    anywhere in the South. That he was sometimes in
    doubt in regard to the identification of this and other
    species may be inferred from his remark, namely: &quot;The
    greater part of our hickories resemble each other so
    closely in their leaves and vary so much in their fruit
    that it is very difficult to discriminate the species.&quot;</p>

<p>It is this difficulty of identification which has led to
    so much confusion in the application of the specific
    names, for the earlier botanists rarely had an opportunity
    of a close and careful examination of the trees or
    other plants which they attempted to describe. In relation
    to the species under consideration, we find that the
    specific name of <i>sulcata</i>, so long in use, was adopted by
    Nuttall, from some earlier or contemporaneous author,&mdash;a
    system he followed with all the different species of
    the hickory, but without, in some instances, any discrimination
    or regard to their adaptation or validity.
    If there was anything to show that Willdenow (1796)
    had this Western shellbark in mind, or that he or his
    correspondents in this country had ever seen or collected
    it, then we might adopt the name of <i>sulcata</i> as the original
    and true one; but in the absence of such information,
    with a full and accurate description of the species
    and its habitats by Michaux, under the name of <i>laciniosa</i>,
    I think, in common justice to one of the most eminent
    dendrologists who ever visited this country, the name
    given should stand as the true one for this species. See
    Michaux, &quot;North American Sylva,&quot; Vol. I, p. 128.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mocker nut, bull nut, big-bud hickory, king

    large, oblong-obovate, rather long pointed, slightly serrate,
    smooth on both sides while young, becoming roughish
    downy underneath when fully developed in summer;
    leaf-stalks and catkins also somewhat downy. Fruit
    medium to very large, round or ovoid, with a very thick
    woody husk, which splits nearly or quite down to the
    base, but usually falling with the enclosed nut entire, or
    bursting open as they strike the ground. Nut very
    thick shelled, smooth, or strongly four to six angled,
    white at first, but becoming a dull brown when exposed
    to the light. The kernel is sweet, but so small and
    firmly imbedded in the thick shell that it is only to be
    removed in minute sections, but this is successfully accomplished
    by the squirrels, who often throw down the
    entire crop from large trees before the shells harden,
    and then pack them away in the ground, in old logs,
    and under the leaves, where they will not dry for some
    weeks or months later. An exceedingly variable species,
    especially in the size and form of the nuts; on some
    trees they are scarcely an inch in diameter, while on
    others they are nearly or quite two inches, but always
    with such a thick, hard shell as to be nearly worthless
    for their meats. The largest of these nuts I have ever
    seen grow in central and western New York, where
    they are called &quot;King&quot; or &quot;Bull&quot; nuts.</p>

<p>The trees grow to a very large size, or from sixty to

    shellbark hickory. The terminal buds, and especially
    those on the young seedlings and suckers springing
    up in clearings, are very large, round, short, and
    covered with brownish scales, hence one of the local
    names of big-bud hickory.</p>
<p>A widely distributed species, or from the valley of
    the St. Lawrence to Florida, and along the great lakes
    to Nebraska, and thence southward to Texas. Unlike
    most of the other hickories, this species seems to prefer
    thin soils, rocky sandstone ridges, and here in New Jersey
    almost disappearing in the rich bottom lands along

<p><strong>Varieties of the Hickories.</strong>&mdash;Every one who
    has ever had occasion to gather or examine hickory nuts
    in the forest, or has seen them in market, must be aware
    of the fact that there is an almost endless variety of each
    and all the different species. But as it
    is only the varieties of the pecan and
    thick- and thin-shelled shagbark hickories
    that are likely to be of any economic
    value to the nut culturist,
    all others will be omitted.
    Of the first or pecan
    nut the natural varieties
    are not only exceedingly
    numerous, but vary widely
    in size, form, thickness
    of shell, and productiveness
    of the individual
    trees. In some the nuts
    are produced singly or in pairs, and from this number
    up to clusters of seven or eight; these large-clustered
    and extra-prolific varieties are most worthy of special
    attention, especially when the nuts are of good size and
    thin-shelled, as in the large, long pecan (Fig. 52). From
    this size they vary, as shown in Figs. 53, 54, 55. Some
    of the wild varieties have received local names, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> very few propagated by grafting, which is probably the
    most practical means known of multiplying them, and
    at the same time preserving their varietal characteristics.
    Choice and extra fine ones are constantly being discovered
    and brought to notice, and doubtless many more
    will follow as the old fields and
    forests of the South and West are
    explored; besides, there are many
    thousands of seedling trees now
    under cultivation, and from these
    we may expect some marked variations
    from the original or wild
    forms. In Bulletin 105, of the
    North Carolina Agricultural Experiment Station for
    1894, and in Report of Assistant Pomologist of U. S.
    Department of Agriculture for same year, we find the
    following-named varieties of pecans:</p>

<p>From the report of
    the Georgia State Horticultural
    Society, 1893, we
    obtain certain local names
    without description, as,
    for instance, Turkey Egg,
    Mexican, Colorado, Pride
    of the Coast, etc. Col. W. R. Stuart, of Ocean Springs,
    Miss., who has been called the &quot;father of pecan culture&quot;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> in that State, and is the author of &quot;The Pecan and
    How to Grow it,&quot; adds two more varieties to the above
    list, viz.: Beauty and Columbia; the latter, as figured
    in the book named, is a very large variety, tapering
    from a broad base to a sharp point. Judge Samuel Miller,
    of Bluffton, Mo., found some very large and fine
    varieties of the pecan in his neighborhood several years
    ago, on the farm of a man named Meyers, and he purchased
    the nuts from the tree bearing the largest in
    the grove and planted them, and the seedlings have
    since been distributed under the name of &quot;Meyers'
    Pecan.&quot;</p>
<p>Judge Miller kindly sent me a quantity of these
    nuts, from which I raised some fifty or more trees, and
    all have thus far been uninjured by the cold of our severest
    winters. From my own experience in raising pecan
    trees, and I may add, that of some of my neighbors,
    those grown from nuts gathered in the more Southern
    States are almost invariably tender here in the North;
    but those raised from thoroughly acclimated trees, along
    the northern limits of this species, will give us a hardy
    race, and probably allow of extending their cultivation
    far north of their natural range. Those who intend to
    try pecan culture in the Northern States should bear
    this in mind, and secure nuts and cions from hardy acclimated
    trees.</p>
<p><strong>Varieties of the Shellbark.</strong>&mdash;Of this species
    (<i>H. alba</i>) there are as many distinct natural varieties as
    of the pecan, and while local or neighborhood names are
    plentiful enough, they have not, except in a very few
    instances, been placed on record in agricultural reports
    or other publications. Three small thin-shelled varieties
    are named in the Report of the Pomologist of the U. S.
    Department of Agriculture for 1891, viz.: Milford,
    Shimar and Leaming, but neither has been propagated,
    and they are probably not worthy of it, because there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> are plenty of larger ones with thin shells which would
    be far more valuable for cultivation.</p>

<p>A careful research extending over a period of a
    quarter of a century yields only a solitary instance of
    the propagation and dissemination of a variety of the
    shellbark hickory, and this one is Hales' Paper-shell,
    which I named, described and figured in the <i>Rural New-Yorker</i>,
    Nov. 19, 1870, p. 382, Vol. XXII. I am thus
    particular in regard to time and place, because years
    hence these facts may be of more importance than at
    the present day.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;"> <img src="images/fig61.jpg" alt="" title="" height="308" width="250" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._61" id="FIG._61">FIG. 61</a>. HALES' HICKORY.</span> </div>

<p>The original tree of this remarkable variety is growing
    upon the farm of Mr. Henry Hales, near Ridgewood,
    N. J., and on bottom land within a few rods of the
    Saddle river. The tree is probably more than a hundred
    years old, and is about seventy-five feet high, and
    nearly two feet in diameter at the base, and of the shape
    shown in Fig. 60, taken from a sketch made in the fall
    of 1894. There
    are a large number
    of the shellbark
    hickories growing
    near by, and while
    there are several
    excellent and very
    large varieties
    among them, the
    one I have named
    is by far the largest and most distinct in form, and with
    the thinnest shell; in fact, the shell is much thinner
    than in many of the pecan nuts that reach our Northern
    markets from the South. The size and form of these
    nuts is clearly shown in Fig. 61, while the thin shell and
    thick, plump kernel is seen in the cross-section, Fig. 62.
    It will be noticed that these nuts differ from the ordinary
    varieties of this species in the absence of the sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> ridges and depressions running from base to point, the
    surface of the shell being broken up into irregular, wavy
    lines, somewhat resembling the shell of the more common
    varieties of the Persian walnuts. I have occasionally
    seen very similar varieties,&mdash;but
    of smaller size,&mdash;among the mixed lots
    of hickory nuts on sale in our city
    markets, also oblong nuts, as shown
    in Fig. 63, but of course there is no
    way of tracing these to the trees producing
    them.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 230px;"> <img src="images/fig63.jpg" alt="" height="368" width="230" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._63" id="FIG._63">FIG. 63</a>. LONG SHELLBARK HICKORY.</span> </div>

<p>Another merit, in addition to the
    large size and thin shell of the Hales'
    Paper-shell, is its keeping qualities,
    the kernels rarely becoming rancid,
    even when two or more years old, and
    from a long acquaintance with this
    nut and hundreds of other varieties gathered from all
    parts of the United States, I am inclined to place it at
    the head of the list, and as the most valuable sort as yet
    discovered. It is true, however,
    that I have found in the forests,
    and also received, many very large
    and superior nuts of this species,
    that are well worthy of propagation
    and cultivation, but they have
    been, in the main, of the typical
    form, and not of so distinct a type
    as this Paper-shell. Judge Miller
    sent me a few nuts of a shellbark
    found in Missouri, that were even
    larger, and with fully as thin shell
    as that of the Hales' (Fig. 64), but upon making
    further inquiries in regard to the tree that produced
    them, I learned that an incoming railroad line had
    destroyed it, and thus one more tree of inestimable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> value had been sacrificed in the march of this progressive
    age.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"> <img src="images/fig65.jpg" alt="" title="" height="440" width="300" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._65" id="FIG._65">FIG. 65</a>. LONG WESTERN SHELLBARK.</span> </div>
<p><strong>Varieties of the Western Shellbark.</strong>&mdash;The
    typical form of the thick or Western shellbark (<i>H. laciniosa</i>)
    has already been shown on a preceding page,
    but some remarkable and valuable varieties have been
    found in the Western States, and no doubt others will
    be, when more attention is paid than at present to the
    natural food products of our forests. The tendency of
    this species, in its variations, is usually in the direction
    of an elongation of the nuts,
    even when there is no decrease
    in the thickness of the shell,
    as shown in Fig. 65, taken
    from one of a number of long
    varieties collected in the Western
    States; and while they do
    not possess any special merit,
    they attract attention, owing
    to their unusual form.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/fig66.jpg" alt="" height="832" width="500" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._66" id="FIG._66">FIG. 66</a>. FRESH NUSSBAUMER HYBRID.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Nussbaumer's Hybrid.</span>&mdash;Several
    years ago I received
    a specimen of a very remarkable
    nut from Judge Samuel
    Miller, of Bluffton, Mo., under
    the name of &quot;Nussbaumer's
    Hybrid Pecan.&quot; Judge Miller informed me that he
    had received it from Mr. J. J. Nussbaumer, Mascoutah,
    St. Clair Co., Ill., who claimed that it was a hybrid
    between the pecan and the large western shellbark hickory
    (<i>H. laciniosa</i>). I had an illustration made of this
    specimen, and it appeared, with a brief description, in
    the <i>American Agriculturist</i> for Dec., 1884, p. 546.
    Soon after receiving the specimen nut from Judge Miller
    I opened correspondence with Mr. Nussbaumer, and
    learned from him that only one tree bearing such nuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> had ever been found, and this was of large size, six and
    a half feet in circumference, and about fifty feet high,
    the bark somewhat like that of the hickory but nearer
    the pecan. Mr. Nussbaumer sent me specimens of the
    green nuts with leaves and twigs, from the original tree.
    The nuts, however, of that season (1884), were badly
    infested with the &quot;hickory-shuck worm&quot; (<i>Grapholitha
    caryana</i>, Fitch), and these had so ruined the shucks,
    and even eaten into the shells of the nuts, that few of
    the specimens received were fully developed. But from
    two nuts I had a sketch made while they were fresh and
    of natural size, as shown in Fig.
    66, the dark, irregular marks on
    the husks showing where the
    shuck worm had attacked them.
    One of these nuts is shown in Fig.
    67, also natural size. I planted
    one of the nuts, from which I now
    have a tree about ten feet high,
    but although ten years old it has
    not fruited, and, so far as I can
    judge from its appearance, is a
    pure Western shellbark, with no
    indication of hybridity; but of
    course this does not prove that
    the original or parent tree is not
    a hybrid, as claimed by Mr. Nussbaumer, Judge Miller,
    and, if I am rightly informed, Prof. T. J. Burrill, of
    the University of Illinois.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 260px;"> <img src="images/fig67.jpg" alt="" title="" height="411" width="260" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._67" id="FIG._67">FIG. 67</a>. NUSSBAUMER'S HYBRID.</span> </div>
<p>However widely opinions may differ in regard to
    the origin of this variety, it is certainly a most remarkable
    nut, and I regret that the exact location of the
    original tree has entirely escaped my most careful seeking;
    and of late years I have been unable to learn anything
    of Mr. Nussbaumer, further than that he had
    moved from Mascoutah to Okawville, Ill., the last letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> received from him being dated Dec. 13, 1887. In one
    of his letters he said that he had raised a large number
    of seedlings from this supposed hybrid, and if these are
    still alive they would be of much scientific interest, especially
    if any of them showed the distinct characteristics
    of either of the supposed parents.</p>
<p>It would certainly be a pity to have such a remarkable
    nut lost to the world, because if propagated by
    grafting or by any other mode to insure perpetuating its
    varietal characteristics, its value could scarcely be estimated.
    The nuts are as thin-shelled as the common
    pecan, the kernel sweet and good, and in addition, the
    tree is a native of a northern State, and would, no
    doubt, prove as hardy as our common shellbark hickories.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Floyd pecan.</span>&mdash;This is another supposed-to-be
    hybrid, and of the same species of hickory as the
    last; but the one nut which I received differed from
    the Nussbaumer by being somewhat larger, and the shell
    with more prominent ridges and a little thicker. It
    was said to have been found somewhere in southern Indiana
    by a Mr. Floyd, who, believing it to be of great
    value, refused to give any information likely to aid any
    one else to locate the original tree, neither would he
    part with any of the nuts except the one specimen which
    eventually came into my hands. Of course all horticulturists
    know that seedlings raised from such freaks
    among nut trees are far too uncertain to be of much
    value, but ignorance in such matters often leads the
    possessor of an article slightly differing from the ordinary
    to permit his imagination to warp his good sense.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivation of the Hickories.</strong>&mdash;The hickories
    have been so seldom planted in our Northern States for
    any purpose, that anything like a systematic cultivation
    of these trees is a thing almost unknown. Of course
    there is no good reason why the hickories should not be
    multiplied and cultivated as well as other kinds of trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> but in some unknown way the idea became prevalent
    that these trees could not be transplanted with any assurance
    of success, and this has been kept alive, either
    through ignorance or by those whose interest led them
    to encourage the planting of the rapid-growing and
    easily propagated kinds, instead of those which, though
    less profitable to the producer, would be of far greater
    value to the purchaser. It must be admitted, however,
    that the hickories are not so tenacious of life as the
    willows, poplars, elms and similar kinds of trees, requiring
    more care in their cultivation if they are to be transplanted
    when of a proper size for setting along roadsides
    or elsewhere, for shade and ornament, but they are certainly
    no more difficult to make live than the beech, oak,
    tulip and various species of the magnolia.</p>
<p>The slow growth of the hickories while young is
    another objection often urged as a fault of these trees,
    but there is nothing lost but time in waiting, and this
    passes just as swiftly whether we plant trees that may in
    ten years yield a golden harvest, or nothing but leaves;
    besides, the hickories respond as readily to stimulants
    and good care generally as the common fruit trees of our
    orchards. While the farmers of our Northern States
    are generally quite indifferent as to what becomes of
    their old hickory trees, and seldom attempt to preserve
    the wild seedlings that spring up in the fields and on
    the borders of forests, their fellow countrymen of the
    Southern States have, within the past two or three
    decades, discovered that they possess an inexhaustible
    source of wealth in their common pecan nut. Formerly
    these trees were sacrificed whenever a choice piece of
    tough timber was wanted, and often merely to secure
    the entire crop of nuts without waiting for nature to
    drop them within reach; but the advent of many lines
    of railroads, steamboats, and other means of communication
    with the great cities and their markets, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> changed this inclination to destroy into one of preservation.
    The old pecan trees are not only appreciated as a
    source of income, but thousands and tens of thousands
    of seedlings are now annually raised and planted, to
    insure larger returns in the near or distant future. In
    fact, pecan culture has already become an important
    industry in several of the Southern States, although in
    point of age it is little more than a fledgling. We have
    no statistics to show what the annual crop averages in
    pounds or bushels, but it must be something enormous
    if we make our estimate from the quantities received
    and distributed in the Northern States. But with all
    the efforts put forth to secure a supply of these nuts,
    and the high prices they command at both wholesale
    and retail, the demand seems to keep well in advance of
    the supply, and this will, in all probability, continue as
    our population increases. In the way of demand, the
    same is true with our northern species of the shellbark
    hickories, which were formerly very abundant, but of
    late years have become rather scarce, for reasons too
    obvious to call for any explanation at this time.</p>
<p>In selecting a location for planting and cultivating
    the hickories, including the pecan, a moist, deep soil is
    certainly preferable to any other, especially for the three
    species and their varieties most promising for this purpose,
    because we find them growing wild in such situations
    and soils. But while these naturally deep, rich
    and moist soils are to be preferred, no one need hesitate
    to plant hickories on light, dry, and even poor soils, if
    they are properly enriched, or a few shovelfuls of fine
    old stable manure is thoroughly mixed with the earth in
    which the roots are set, and then a mulch applied to
    the surface to keep the soil moist. Almost any old
    waste fibrous material, such as leaves, straw, hay, weeds
    or coarse manure, will answer for mulching newly planted
    trees, and it should be applied to a depth of three or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> four inches, and renewed annually, or as often as necessary
    to prevent the growth of grass or weeds growing
    within three or four feet of the stem of the tree. In all
    dry climates and soils mulching should be considered an
    important operation, not to be omitted until the trees
    are from six to ten years old, and it may usually be continued
    a longer time with benefit.</p>
<p><strong>Propagation.</strong>&mdash;All the species of the hickory are
    very readily grown from nuts gathered when ripe and
    planted within a few weeks; or they may be mixed with
    or stratified between layers of sand and light soil and
    buried in the open ground for the winter, and the planting
    deferred until the following spring. They are not
    at all delicate and will withstand considerable drying
    and neglect, and will grow, if stored in a cool cellar,
    without being packed in either soil, sand or other material.
    But as I have had no occasion to determine how
    much neglect these nuts will withstand, nor to what
    extremes of adverse conditions it is safe to subject them,
    I shall leave investigation in this direction to others,
    because in general practice no valuable seed or plant
    grows any too readily and freely to satisfy the cultivator,
    and for this reason I recommend either planting hickory
    nuts in the fall, or burying them between layers of light
    soil or sand, sifting out and planting early the following
    spring. If any considerable quantity is to be
    planted they should be dropped three or four inches
    apart in shallow trenches and covered about two inches
    deep. The distance between the rows may be from two
    to three feet, depending upon the implements to be used
    in their cultivation.</p>
<p>The soil for a seedbed should, of course, be made
    rich and deep, or the same as recommended for chestnuts,
    and all the means usually employed to assist the
    growth of cultivated plants are applicable to nut trees.
    I may also add that cutworms, white grubs and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> noxious insects are enemies of nut-tree seedlings as well
    as garden vegetables. The seedling hickories should
    be treated as advised for chestnuts; that is, dug up
    when one or, at the latest, two years old, and their
    central or taproot shortened to at least one-half their
    original length, and then reset in nursery rows, and at
    a distance of twelve to fifteen inches apart in the row.
    If grown in ordinary upland, the transplanted seedlings
    will make a better growth if heavily mulched than under
    the usual system of clean cultivation, and it is usually
    less expensive; besides, by keeping the surface of
    the soil cool and moist, we encourage and assist the production
    of fibrous lateral roots, which, as a rule, are
    none too abundant on seedling hickories, no matter
    under what conditions or system of cultivation they
    are raised.</p>
<p>When the seedlings have grown in the nursery rows
    two or three years, they will probably be large enough
    for planting where they are to remain permanently; but
    if, for any reason, they are not disposed of, then they
    should be again transplanted,&mdash;the larger roots shortened,&mdash;and
    re-set in good rich soil. The object of transplanting
    is to insure the production of small fibrous
    roots, and a frequent renewal of the same, close to the
    main stem or stock, as long as the trees remain in the
    nursery, whether this be two or twenty years. This
    is somewhat of an expensive operation, but the value of
    stock thus handled is enhanced far more than the cost
    of such transplanting, and purchasers are, or at least
    should be, willing to pay a fair price for such trees.</p>
<p>It is the natural habit of the hickories, as well as
    many other kinds of deciduous trees, to produce in their
    earlier stages of growth rather large, deeply penetrating,
    naked roots, with few small fibers, and in this condition
    they are not so readily and successfully transplanted as
    the kinds possessing a more ramified root system. This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> perhaps, has misled many persons to believe that certain
    kinds of trees, like the hickories, could not be moved at
    all, or at least not with any assurance of being made to
    live. This idea has become so prevalent among inexperienced
    cultivators, and, I regret to add, often reiterated
    by theorists, that it has discouraged many who
    otherwise would have raised and planted nut trees in
    preference to other kinds.</p>
<p>Admitting that it is the general habit of most kinds
    of forest trees to produce deeply penetrating taproots,
    when grown from seed, it proves nothing more than
    that these parts may be of some importance to the plants
    while they are young, and under natural conditions, yet
    they are not absolutely necessary, and, at most, are only
    temporary organs, like the tails of tadpoles, always disappearing
    with maturity.</p>
<p>Any one at all observing, and having had an opportunity
    of examining limited or extended areas of forest
    trees thrown over by hurricanes, must have noticed that
    no tree of any considerable size and age possessed a taproot,
    but had been for years kept in its upright position
    by lateral brace-roots, and through these it had also
    obtained nutriment from the surface soil. Some of my
    correspondents in the South have expressed their surprise
    at not finding any trace of the original central
    roots on old pecan trees, when blown over by severe
    wind storms. But it is the same everywhere with forest
    trees and where the soil is naturally loose and moist:
    the principal or supporting roots spread out widely and
    remain near the surface, and the central roots or taproots
    disappear much earlier than in dry soils.</p>
<p>In multiplying trees under artificial conditions, we
    remove the taproots, not only for convenience in transplanting,
    but also to hasten and increase the production
    of surface lateral roots, and more than this, we lessen
    the years of luxuriant sterility, securing earlier fruiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> by such operations as root pruning and frequent
    transplanting.</p>
<p><strong>Budding and Grafting.</strong>&mdash;I have never known of
    an instance of successful budding of the hickory, at least
    in the ordinary way during the summer months. What
    is called &quot;annular budding&quot; in early spring with buds
    of the previous season, is said to have been successfully
    practiced with the pecan at the South, but this mode of
    propagation is more of the nature of grafting than of
    what is usually understood as budding. But I have
    been unable to obtain any statistics in regard to the proportion
    of buds that any propagator or experimenter has
    made live by this or other modes of propagation. Col.
    Stuart says, in &quot;The Pecan,&quot; p. 45, &quot;There is a method
    known as 'annular budding,' which proves quite successful.&quot;
    He then proceeds to describe the operation,
    as given in all works on the propagation of trees and
    plants during the past hundred years or more, but not a
    word to indicate what he considers a &quot;success,&quot;&mdash;whether
    it be once or fifty times in a hundred, or if he
    ever succeeded in making an annular bud unite to the
    stock; I am more inclined to think that he never did,
    than otherwise.</p>
<p>In Bulletin No. 105, &quot;Nut Culture for North Carolina,&quot;
    issued from the N. C. State Experiment Station,
    1894, Mr. W. A. Taylor, Assistant Pomologist U. S.
    Department of Agriculture, in referring to budding and
    grafting of these trees, says: &quot;These latter operations
    are less successful with the pecan than most fruit trees,
    though they are by no means impossible to accomplish.
    On seedlings one or two years old annular budding in
    early summer succeeds best.&quot; But here again we are
    left in doubt in regard to what the writer considers &quot;a
    success.&quot; Then, again, the line between the &quot;possible&quot;
    and &quot;impossible,&quot; in horticultural matters, is a rather
    difficult one to determine, and Mr. Taylor fails to cite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> single instance in which either annular or any other
    form of either budding or grafting had been successfully
    practiced. The Bulletins issued from the Division of
    Pomology of the Department of Agriculture, give us no
    information whatever on this subject of propagation of
    the hickories, further than to repeat the old formulas of
    annular, splice and cleft grafting; but as to results they
    have always been provokingly silent.</p>
<p>Having been repeatedly assured, by men who presumed
    to know, that the pecan tree was successfully
    propagated in the South by grafting, and many thousands
    annually raised in this way, it seems strange that
    such plants are so rarely offered by nurserymen. Seedlings
    of choice varieties are, of course, abundant enough,
    but a man might, with as much propriety, offer seedling
    Bartlett pears or Baldwin apples, as pecan trees, expecting
    to perpetuate varieties. In corresponding with Mr.
    P. J. Berckmans, of the Fruitland Nurseries of Augusta,
    Ga., whose experience and acquaintance with the fruits
    of the South are, without doubt, in advance of any other
    horticulturist of the past or even the present generation,
    in reply to my request for information on grafting
    pecans, he writes: &quot;For the past five or six years we
    have grafted various varieties of the pecan nuts. I do
    not know of any other nurseryman South who offers
    grafted trees. I presume the reason of this is, the
    great difficulty in having the grafts take, as we seldom
    have more than fifteen to twenty-five per cent. grow.
    We usually crown graft in February, using one-year-old
    seedlings grown in nursery rows. Owing to the small
    percentage of grafts which grow, grafted trees must,
    necessarily, be quite expensive, and for this reason there
    are so few attempts made in this method of propagation.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Berckmans makes no reference to annular budding
    of the pecan, so strongly and frequently recommended
    by the several writers already quoted, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> I am certain that he is as familiar with this mode of
    propagation as any one else, and would have practiced
    it had he found it in any way superior to crown grafting.
    From all that I have been able to learn through a
    rather extended correspondence, in regard to the propagation
    of the pecan nut tree in the South, I conclude
    that they are occasionally and sparingly grafted, but
    with such indifferent results that they are not at all
    numerous in either orchards or nurseries.</p>
<p>From certain remarks of Col. Stuart, in his essay
    on &quot;Pecan Culture,&quot; I infer that he has sold grafted
    trees, for he says: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;It costs no more to care for the
        grove of choice trees than of poor ones; then, again, the
        grafted or budded ones come into profitable bearing
        three years earlier than seedlings. Here is a case in
        point: Last November (1892) we paid, in cash, two
        hundred and forty-eight dollars for the nuts which grew
        upon one tree, the crop of one year. The tree is twenty
        inches through at its base, and forty-five feet high; such
        a size tree would grow in twenty or twenty-five years.
        Now small nuts from the same size tree will sell for not
        more than fifteen to twenty dollars. Another tree only
        ten years old bore thirteen and a half dollars worth.
        These choice nuts are such as we grow seedlings from;
        we sell a great many more seedlings than we do grafted
        or budded trees, simply because they are so much
        cheaper, and people in general do not realize that such a
        vast difference exists between the profits of seedling and
        grafted or budded trees; but such is the case, and such it
        will always remain for aught we can see.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after I
    published the description of the Hales' Paper-shell hickory
    in 1870, requests for cions were received from nurserymen
    and many amateur horticulturists, who were
    anxious to try their skill in grafting this excellent variety.
    Mr. Hales generously responded, and sent cions to
    a large number of correspondents in various parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> country, because he was desirous of having the variety
    preserved and propagated. During the following ten
    years the old original tree was kept pretty well pruned,
    in filling orders for cions; those sent to nurserymen
    were to be raised on shares, one-half of all the successfully
    grafted trees to be returned to Mr. Hales. Being
    a near neighbor, my opportunities for keeping informed
    as to the result of this arrangement was all that I could
    desire. To one nursery firm in central New York Mr.
    Hales sent about one thousand cions per annum for four
    successive years, and in return received just four feeble
    grafted plants as his share of the total product of the
    four thousand cions. But as the four plants received
    soon died, he closed that account as one of total loss.
    Previously, however, he had sent a quantity of cions to
    Mr. J. R. Trumpy, of the Kissena Nurseries, Flushing,
    N. Y., whose skill as a propagator of ligneous plants is
    probably second to that of no man in this country; the
    result proved that our faith in the man was not misplaced,
    for Mr. Hales received for his share of the experiment
    something over two dozen grafted trees, and
    most of these are now handsome specimens ten to twenty
    feet high. Just what percentage of the cions set were
    made to unite and grow I have not been informed, but
    the experiment was, doubtless, rather unsatisfactory as a
    commercial transaction.</p>
<p>In addition to the plants sent to Mr. Hales, there
    have been quite a number distributed among the customers
    of the nurseries named; consequently, we are
    pretty well assured of the perpetuation of this remarkably
    fine variety, even when the original tree succumbs
    to old age, or should it be accidentally destroyed. I am
    inclined to give Mr. Trumpy credit for being the first
    man to graft the shellbark hickory in this or any other
    country, and make the cions unite and grow, for I
    have failed to find any instance of success in this mode<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> of propagating these trees, prior to his with the Hales'
    Paper-shell.</p>
<p>In reply to a note sent him a few months since, asking:
    &quot;How did or do you graft the hickories?&quot; he
    replied as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;I put the hickory stocks in pots in
        the spring, and graft them the following spring, say in
        April, and in the house. The cions are cut during the
        winter, so as to keep them in good order until wanted
        for use. I find it is better to operate in April than
        earlier in the winter. I also graft them out of doors
        about the beginning of May, when the stocks are growing.
        They will succeed very well out of doors, provided
        the stocks are large enough for the cions. Any kind of
        grafting will do, but crown grafting is the best. I have
        not done much of late in the way of grafting hickories
        in the nursery, not having suitable stocks; besides, when
        the weather becomes warm enough for outside work, vegetation
        pushes far too rapidly to give a man a chance to
        do much of this kind of grafting.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the above was written and while these pages
    were being put in type, Mr. Jackson Dawson, of the
    Arnold Arboretum, Jamaica Plain, Mass., has given his
    method of grafting the hickories, in <i>Garden and Forest</i>,
    Feb. 19, 1896, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;My method,&quot; writes Mr. Dawson, &quot;has been to
        side-graft, using a cion with part of the second year's
        wood attached, binding it firmly and covering it with
        damp sphagnum until the union has been made. The
        best time I have found for the operation under glass has
        been during February, and the plants have been kept
        under glass until midsummer, and wintered the first
        year in a cold frame. In all the genera I find certain
        species which may be called free stocks,&mdash;that is, stocks
        which take grafts more readily than others. Thus,
        nearly all the oaks will graft readily on <i>Quercus Robur</i>;
        the birches will graft more easily on <i>Betula alba</i> than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> on others; so of the hickories, observation has led me
        to believe that the best stock is the bitternut, <i>Hicoria
        minima</i>. This species grows almost twice as rapidly as
        the common shagbark hickory, and while young the
        cambium is quite soft. I should advise anyone who
        wishes to propagate hickories on a large scale to grow
        stocks of this species in boxes not more than four inches
        deep. In this way all the roots can be saved and there
        will be no extreme taproot, and when shaken out of the
        boxes the plants are easily established in pots and ready
        for grafting. If taken up in the ordinary way from the
        woods, it requires almost two years to get them well
        rooted, and often the stocks die for want of roots after
        the grafts have really taken. If grown in rich soil, the
        stocks will be large enough to use in one or two years.
        I should then pot them early in the fall, keeping them
        from heavy frosts, and bringing them into the house
        about the first of January, and as soon as they begin to
        make roots. I should side-graft them close to the collar
        and plunge them in sphagnum moss, leaving the top
        bud of the graft out to the air. The graft ought to be
        well united about the last of March, when the plants
        should be taken from the sphagnum and set in the body
        of the house to finish their growth.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All who have had any experience in the propagation
    of trees by grafting in spring, are well aware of the flight
    of time, in the hurry of work that must be done in a
    few days or not at all. It is true that the season for
    grafting may be prolonged or extended a little by cutting
    the cions in winter and storing them in a cool,
    moist place, where they remain dormant after vegetation
    has started in the open air; but this does not affect the
    stocks, and these may come on slowly or rapidly, varying
    with the seasons, and the grafter must not only watch
    for opportune moments, but take his chances of striking
    the right time and conditions, in order to be successful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> With such hard wood trees as the hickories it is better
    to be a little ahead of time than a few days too late, for
    frosts, and even quite a severe freeze, will not injure a
    dormant cion, and under the most favorable conditions
    the union between stock and cion is a rather slow process.
    For this reason I advise giving as much time as
    possible, and while I do not claim to having had any
    personal experience as a grafter, in the South, still I am
    inclined to think that grafting in the fall, and not later
    than December, would be preferable to later in winter
    or spring. By giving the cion and stock two or three
    months in which to form granulations and cohesion,
    there would be more certainty of success. Of course, I
    now refer to what is called crown grafting on the root
    below the surface of the ground, and when the cion is
    fixed in place with the usual ligatures of waxed paper or
    cloth, the soil is drawn back into place and the cion
    entirely covered with it, but very lightly over the terminal
    bud.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/fig68.jpg" alt="" height="371" width="500" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._68" id="FIG._68">FIG. 68</a>. CROWN GRAFTING ON ROOTS OF THE HICKORY.</span> </div>
<p>Where small stocks are not at hand, the roots of
    large trees may be severed and the end partly lifted
    towards the surface, as shown in Fig. 68, and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> grafted, allowed to remain in position until the following
    season, and then taken up entire or with roots
    enough to insure future growth. The same or a similar
    process may be practiced to propagate a choice variety
    of the hickory, and a mere severing of the roots will
    insure the production of suckers from near the severed
    end, as shown in Fig. 69.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/fig69.jpg" alt="" height="469" width="500" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._69" id="FIG._69">FIG. 69</a>. SPROUTS FROM SEVERED HICKORY ROOTS.</span> </div>
<p>In grafting isolated stocks in this way, a small or
    large stake should be placed by the side of each, to indicate
    their position, and also protect them from being
    trampled upon. I make this suggestion because, in my
    own experience, it has often proved successful with various
    kinds of hard-wooded trees and shrubs that failed
    when grafted in the spring. Here in the North it is
    rather difficult, as well as expensive, to protect cions set
    in the open ground in the fall; but in the South it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> different, and a handful of almost any coarse litter would
    be sufficient to prevent severe freezing.</p>
<p>But grafting in the fall in the open ground is unnecessary,
    where small seedling stocks are used in the
    propagation of any kind of tree; in fact, nurserymen do
    very little grafting of this kind in spring, for they
    learned, by long experience, that the most economical
    and certain method of multiplying such trees is to take
    up the stocks in the fall, and then graft them indoors
    during the winter, having stocks and cions stored in
    cool cellars or pits, where they will be readily accessible
    when wanted. Apples, pears, quinces, grapes, and
    many other kinds of hardy trees, shrubs and vines are
    now extensively propagated by grafting during the winter
    months, and I do not know of any good reason why
    the hickories and other closely allied nut trees should
    not be multiplied in this way. I have tried it, on a limited
    scale, with the shellbark hickories, and with fair
    success, and in my opinion it is the only way by which
    the hickories, including the pecan, can be multiplied
    cheaply enough to become of commercial importance.</p>
<p>The small stocks of one or two years old should be
    taken up in the fall, and then crown grafted any time
    from December to March in the Northern States, but
    the earlier the better; then pack away the grafted stocks
    in moss or soil, in a cool cellar, or heel-in elsewhere, as,
    for instance, in pits or frames, where they will not be
    frozen, and yet cool enough to prevent active growth.</p>
<p>In the spring the grafted stocks should be planted
    out in nursery rows, and deep enough to have the top of
    the cion just level with the surface after the soil has
    been settled about it by a shower or heavy rains. The
    plants must be handled with care, so as not to disturb
    the cions. Mulching will, of course, be beneficial in
    dry seasons, and especially if the stocks are set in ordinary
    well-drained soils. In selecting wood for cions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> twigs of the previous season's growth are usually preferred,
    but it is not necessary, nor is it advisable to discard
    all except the extreme end of the shoot or that
    containing a terminal bud, as some writers have advised,
    to prevent rapid loss of moisture by evaporation, for a
    drop of wax will seal the end of a cion as thoroughly
    and effectually as a natural bud; besides, the lower part
    of the annual twigs is often more firm and really better
    for grafting than the upper and less sturdy wood, and
    the lateral buds on it will push just as readily as the
    terminal one. The cion may be three or four inches
    long, and contain two or more buds. The sealing of
    the upper end of a cion that is not protected by a terminal
    bud is certainly important with all of the hickories,
    for in this genus of trees the pith is large and
    continuous, not intersected or cut off by a thin partition
    of wood at the joints, as seen in many trees, shrubs and
    vines. This large and continuous pith in the hickories
    is another reason why the cions succeed best if set below
    the crown and in or on the fleshy roots having no pith.
    They may be set on one side, as in splice grafting, or in
    the center, or in a cleft made for their reception with a
    sharp knife, then bound with waxed paper, or wrapped
    with bass, raffia, or other similar material, and afterwards
    covered with melted wax to exclude air and water
    from the joints and wounds.</p>
<p>In this mode of grafting hickories it is not necessary
    to employ the entire root or stock, if it is of large
    size, for a single cion; for pieces of from six to twelve
    inches long, containing a few lateral fibers, will answer
    the purpose, and it will be found, in practice, that these
    sections of the large fleshy roots contain so much vitality
    that, if the cions set in them fail to grow, they will
    throw up sprouts from adventitious buds during the
    ensuing summer. Almost any fair-sized piece of root
    left in the ground, when digging up hickory trees large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> or small, is pretty certain to throw up sprouts, this not
    only showing their great vitality, but that propagation
    by root cuttings is perfectly practicable and may be utilized
    whenever and wherever it may be desirable. The
    man who attempts to raise hickories from root cuttings
    must have patience, for very frequently the cuttings
    will remain apparently dormant in the ground one entire
    season before the sprouts appear above the surface. I
    will also add that this slow or retarded germination frequently
    occurs with the nuts, especially if they have
    become somewhat dry before planting.</p>
<p>For commercial purposes root-grafting small stock,
    as described, during the fall and winter, gives promise
    of being the best and most practicable system of multiplying
    varieties; but there is much yet to be learned in
    regard to details, and hundreds of carefully conducted
    experiments may be necessary to determine the exact
    time, condition and mode of operation. It may be that
    very early grafting is better than late, or that we have
    not, as yet, found the best species for stocks, and that a
    half-ripened one will be preferable to one fully matured.
    Neither has it, as yet, been determined what kind of
    material is best in which to store the grafted roots: sand,
    soil or sphagnum (moss) from the swamps; or whether
    they should be kept very moist, or comparatively dry;
    very cold, or moderately warm. Here is a wide field for
    experiments, and a most interesting one; for the successful
    propagation of the hickories by any mode that
    will insure the perpetuation and rapid multiplication of
    varieties, means millions of dollars added to the wealth
    of the country.</p>
<p><strong>Age of Fruiting.</strong>&mdash;We hear much of the precociousness
    of pecan trees in the South, and many are
    reported as coming into bearing at the age of six to ten
    years from the time of planting the nut; but these are
    probably exceptional instances of early fruiting and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> the rule, although in a favorable soil and climate it is to
    be expected that such trees will push forward more rapidly
    than under less favorable conditions. Grafted trees
    will, of course, produce fruit in less time than seedlings,
    and as this mode of propagation becomes more general,
    and repeated in a direct ancestral line, the cions for each
    successive generation of trees being taken from mature
    or bearing specimens, the precocious and productive
    habit will eventually become intensified, as it has been
    in all of our long-cultivated fruit trees propagated by
    artificial methods. We have so intensified the productiveness
    of many kinds of cultivated fruits by selection,
    that it has become more of a fault, than a merit to be
    encouraged.</p>
<p>The nut trees are amenable to the same physiological
    laws as other kinds, and in their propagation by
    grafting with cions from bearing specimens we hasten
    maturity in the offspring. This has been fully demonstrated
    in many varieties of the Persian walnuts and
    European chestnuts. Here in the Northern States we
    have had so little experience with grafted hickories of
    any species, that really nothing is yet known as to how
    they will respond to this mode of propagation, further
    than that they grow rapidly and give promise of being
    fruitful. Seedling trees are, as a rule, of slow growth,
    rarely attaining a bearing age and size under twenty
    years, and with the shellbarks thirty or forty years usually
    pass before anything like a crop of nuts is gathered.
    Something may be gained, in the way of time, by frequent
    transplantings and pruning, but more by grafting
    seedlings from old and mature trees. Two grafts of the
    Hales' hickory commenced bearing at the age of sixteen
    years.</p>
<p><strong>Planting for Profit.</strong>&mdash;There are, doubtless, many
    thousands of acres of half-denuded woodlands in almost
    every State in the Union, both North and South, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> could be readily utilized for growing hickory timber,
    and much of such lands is almost useless for other purposes;
    but timber culture and forestry is a subject
    which I have discussed elsewhere,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> while the object of
    this work is to aid my readers in producing something that
    may be utilized as food. When the hundreds and thousands
    of miles of our public highways are shaded with
    hickory and other nut-bearing trees of the best species
    and varieties, it will be time enough to begin planting
    such kinds elsewhere. As roadside trees they cannot
    fail to be profitable, largely enhancing the value of adjoining
    land; for in addition to being equally as ornamental
    as other kinds, they yield fruit always in demand
    at remunerative prices. The three species of the hickory
    and their varieties recommended for cultivation all
    thrive best in moist soils, but by occasional watering or
    thorough mulching they will succeed almost anywhere,
    especially in naturally dry locations.</p>

<p><strong>Insect Enemies.</strong>&mdash;The hickories, as with all other
    nut-bearing trees, have numerous insect enemies, but
    these are neither so numerous nor destructive as to seriously
    interfere with their growth in general, or with
    their productiveness. Insects may occasionally become
    exceedingly numerous in certain localities for a few
    years, then suddenly or slowly disappear; but this we
    must expect, as one of the coexisting phases of all agricultural
    pursuits.</p>
<p>Collectively the hickories have no considerable number
    of destructive insect enemies, but if we count all the
    species of the various orders that have been found occasionally,
    or otherwise, feeding on the leaves, buds, fruit,
    twigs, bark, or boring in the solid wood, they make a
    very formidable list of names, or about one hundred and
    seventy-five in all; but fully ninety per cent. of these <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> depredators are scarcely known, except to a few professional
    entomologists, and unless they become more destructive
    in the future than they are at present, or have
    been in years past, nut culturists have little to fear from
    their depredations. Among the most common species
    of insects injurious to the hickory, the following may
    prove most annoying to the cultivator. </p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;"> <img src="images/fig70.jpg" alt="" height="494" width="250" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._70" id="FIG._70">FIG. 70</a>.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">The hickory-twig girdler</span> (<i>Oncideres cingulatus.</i> Say).&mdash;A small yellowish-gray beetle, a little less
    than an inch long, usually appearing in this latitude
    during August, the females depositing their eggs in the
    twigs of from a quarter to a half-inch in diameter.
    On old large trees the loss of a few or
    many of these is scarcely noticed; but on
    young seedlings or grafted stock it is quite
    a different affair, for on such plants the
    females usually select the leader in preference
    to the lateral twigs in which to deposit
    their eggs. The female girdles the
    twigs for the purpose of providing proper
    and acceptable food for her progeny; that
    is, first the green, then the slowly drying,
    then the perfectly hard, seasoned hickory
    or whatever kind she may have attacked.
    Selecting a suitable twig, she rests upon
    it, usually with head downward (Fig. 70), and with her
    mandibles cuts out a ring of bark about one-twelfth of
    an inch wide, and deep enough to reach the firm wood
    underneath. The place selected for this annular incision
    may be only a few inches from the terminal bud, or
    a foot below it, and in some instances she will cut two
    incisions on the same twig some distance apart, but
    usually there is only one on a twig. While cutting this
    incision she will sometimes rest long enough from her
    labors to deposit an egg in the bark above. The number
    of eggs she deposits in the twig is probably variable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> but three full-grown grubs is the most I have ever found,
    and the larger proportion examined had only one. This
    girdling of the twig prevents the flow of sap, and the
    leaves soon wither and drop off, and the bark and wood
    shrivel and become hard and dry; but in the meantime
    the eggs have hatched and the minute grubs have
    bored their way through the soft bark and reached the
    pith, feeding in this while acquiring size and strength
    of jaws that will enable them to consume more solid
    food later and during the succeeding winter, spring and
    summer. Some do not reach maturity until the second
    summer; at least, in this latitude, as I have found after
    very careful observation and while collecting many hundreds
    of specimens. I will say, however, that this insect
    is usually referred to by entomologists as rather
    rare, and in general it is, but some years ago, in an old
    clearing near by where there was a great number of
    young hickory seedlings and sprouts, it was for a season
    or two very abundant; then it suddenly disappeared,
    and I have not taken a half-dozen specimens since. The
    grubs bore out the wood in the infested twig, and in
    most instances so completely as to leave only a thin shell
    of the wood or bark, by the time they have reached maturity
    and are ready to pass into their imago or perfect-winged
    stage.</p>
<p>This species of twig girdler also attacks the apple,
    pear, persimmon, elm, and other kinds of trees, and
    with those like the apple, with a soft and brittle wood,
    the girdled twigs are frequently broken off by the winds;
    but this rarely occurs with the hickories, and we can
    usually find the stumps remaining on the trees years
    after the beetles have emerged. The only way to keep
    this pest in check is to cut off and burn the girdled
    twigs any time before the larvæ have reached maturity,
    and as the girdled dead twigs are readily seen, the gathering
    is not difficult, from medium-sized trees.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">The painted hickory borer</span> (<i>Cyllene pictus.</i> Drury).&mdash;This is, perhaps, one of the most common and
    widely distributed of all the hickory borers, but, so far
    as my observations have extended, it rarely attacks
    young or healthy trees of any age; in fact, I have never
    found it in or about growing trees, but I have seen it,
    by the thousands, breeding in decaying specimens and
    in hickory cordwood cut during the winter months and
    ranked up in shady places. A hickory tree cut down in
    fall or winter, and left on the ground or cut up into
    cordwood, is pretty sure to attract this borer early in
    spring, the females swarming over the bark, depositing
    their eggs upon it, and by the ensuing autumn the wood
    will be fairly honeycombed if this insect is at all abundant.
    The general color of the beetle is
    black, and the size as shown in Fig. 71.
    There are three narrow, whitish bands
    across the top of the thorax, and one
    slightly broader band at the extreme point
    of the wing-covers; but the next band is
    in the form of an inverted <span class="larft"> <strong>V</strong></span>; the point
    of the <span class="larft"><strong>Λ</strong></span> does not quite touch the broad
    lateral band, as in the closely allied species known as
    the locust borer (<i>C. robiniæ</i>), with which it is often
    confounded; besides, in the latter the markings are of a
    deep yellow, and not white or of a faint yellowish tinge.
    The hickory borer always appears in spring, and the
    locust borer in the fall, not later than September in this
    part of the country. Below or behind the <span class="larft"> <strong>V</strong></span>-shaped
    band there are three others, but all broken up into mere
    dots, and not continuous.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 130px;"> <img src="images/fig71.jpg" alt="" title="" height="164" width="130" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._71" id="FIG._71">FIG. 71</a>.
    HICKORY BORER.</span> </div>
<p>In the South, and especially in Texas, there is a
    somewhat smaller but closely allied species (<i>Cyllene
    crinicornis</i>) that attacks the pecan tree and its wood in
    the same way as our common hickory borer, but in the
    Southern or Southwestern species the bands on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> wing-covers are all interrupted or broken up into small
    white spots or dots. I have no remedy to suggest, further
    than to cut down old, infested trees, and to haul
    the wood out into the sun and spread it out where it
    will quickly dry and become seasoned. If the felled
    tree and wood is stripped of its bark as soon as cut, the
    female beetles will not deposit their eggs upon it.</p>
<p>There are other long-horned beetles (<i>Cerambycidæ</i>)
    that are occasionally found breeding in the hickories,
    and among these may be named the Belted Chion (<i>Chion
    cinctus</i>), Tiger Goes (<i>Goes tigrinus</i>), Beautiful Goes
    (<i>Goes pulchra</i>), and the Orange Sawyer (<i>Elaphidion
    inerme</i>), but they are usually quite too rare to be considered
    as very destructive insects.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hickory-bark borer</span> (<i>Scolytus 4-spinosus.</i> Say).&mdash;Only
    once within my memory has this minute but
    destructive beetle appeared in any considerable numbers
    in my neighborhood, although I have occasionally
    received a few specimens from correspondents in various
    parts of the country, even as far west as the Pacific coast
    in Washington. This borer is a very small, cylindrical,
    dark brown beetle, about one-fifth of an inch or less in
    length, and one-sixteenth in diameter. The hind part
    of the body is quite blunt (truncate), the males having
    four short but distinct blunt spines, two on each side,
    projecting from the hind part of the abdomen, hence
    the name &quot;4-spinosus.&quot; In the females these spines
    are absent, otherwise they closely resemble the males.
    These bark borers usually appear here in the Northern
    States the last of June or early in July, and both sexes
    attack hickory trees of all species, but appear to prefer
    the old and nearly mature trees to the young and small
    with thinner bark. After boring through the bark and
    reaching the soft cambium layer underneath, upon
    which these insects feed, the female cuts a vertical channel
    in this substance, of little over an inch in length.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 380px;"> <img src="images/fig72.jpg" alt="" title="" height="526" width="380" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._72" id="FIG._72">FIG. 72</a>. BURROWS OF HICKORY SCOLYTUS.</span> </div>
<p>This burrow is a little larger than the diameter of her
    body, and along on both sides she deposits her eggs, to
    the number of ten to thirty, placing about an equal
    number on each side. When these eggs hatch, the young
    larvæ begin to feed on the soft material by which they
    are surrounded, making minute burrows at first, and at
    nearly right angles with the parent one; but as they
    increase in size they are forced to diverge, those above
    the center working upward, and those below downward,
    as shown in Fig. 72. These burrows enlarge as the
    grubs increase in size, as
    shown, most of them
    reaching their full development
    by the time cold
    weather sets in, but
    some do not cease feeding
    until spring, then
    pass to the pupal stage,
    and later to the perfect
    or beetle form, and from
    the extreme end of these
    burrows they bore a hole
    straight out to the surface,
    and are then ready
    to begin the cycle of life
    again, either on the tree
    from which they have
    emerged, or others near by. Some fifteen years ago I
    noticed that the leaves of some of the old hickory trees
    on my place were turning yellow prematurely, and upon
    examination I found the bark perforated with minute
    holes not larger than small bird shot, indicating the
    presence of the bark borer under consideration. Seven
    of the very largest and, presumably, the oldest, appeared
    to be affected, and these were immediately cut down and
    stripped of their bark, exposing the little grubs to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span> air and attacks of insect-eating birds. These trees appeared
    to have been infested for several years, as there
    was scarcely a spot on the surface of the wood that had
    not been scarified with this pest. Since the destruction
    of these trees I have not been troubled with bark borers,
    although there are still a number of very old and large
    hickories thriving in the same grove. The only remedy
    I can suggest is to cut down infested trees as soon as
    they are discovered, and also encourage the insect-eating
    birds to remain in and near the nut groves.</p>
<p>There are several other species of bark borers that
    occasionally attack hickories, one of these, the <i>Chramesus
    icoriæ</i>, Leconte, infests the small twigs, while
    another, the <i>Sinoxylon basilare</i>, say, after boring
    through the bark, continues its course far into the heartwood,
    showing a preference for this kind of food instead
    of the living tissues. These pests, however, are rarely
    constant, but very erratic, in their attacks, and while
    they may be rather abundant on a few or many trees a
    season or two, they then disappear, and not one may be
    seen for several decades.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The hickory-shuck worm</span> (<i>Grapholitha caryana.</i> Fitch).&mdash;The parent of this pest is a minute moth of
    the family <i>Tortricidæ</i>, the small caterpillars mining and
    boring the green husks, and sometimes into the immature
    shell, causing the nuts to wither and drop off prematurely,
    although an occasional one may reach maturity,
    even in its scarified condition. This insect appears
    to be somewhat rare in the East, but very abundant
    some years in the West, where it is frequently destructive
    to the thick shellbark hickory and pecan. The first
    fresh specimens of the Nussbaumer Hybrid pecan nut
    (referred to on a preceding page) were so badly bored
    and scarified by this worm when received, that they
    would have been nearly or quite worthless for either
    planting or other purposes. As this insect attacks the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span> nuts on the very largest trees in the forest and elsewhere,
    I cannot suggest any other remedy than to gather the
    immature and infested nuts as they fall, and burn them,
    with their contents.</p>
<p>Among the larger Lepidoptera (butterflies and
    moths) there are many species, the caterpillars of which
    occasionally feed on the leaves of the hickories, but not
    exclusively; consequently, they cannot be considered as
    the special enemies of this genus of trees. When they
    do attack them, it is as much due to accident as design.
    This is certainly true with the great Luna moth (<i>Attacus
    luna</i>) and the American silk worm (<i>Telea polyphemus</i>),
    and various species of the Catocala, as well as the Tent
    caterpillar (<i>Clisiocampa sylvatica</i>).</p>
<p>There is also a hickory-nut weevil, closely allied to
    the species infesting the chestnut; and while not quite
    as large, its habits are similar, and its ravages may be
    checked by the same or similar means. The grubs bore
    into the green nuts, causing some to fall before half-grown;
    others may remain in the nuts until they are
    ripe and gathered in the autumn; consequently, perforated
    hickory nuts are not at all rare, even on the
    stands of venders in our cities.</p>
<p>Bud worms, leaf miners, leaf rollers and plant lice,&mdash;and
    among the latter several gall-making species,&mdash;are
    to be found on the hickories; but with all these natural
    enemies to contend with, the hickories thrive, grow, and
    yield their fruits in greater or less abundance. To enumerate,
    describe and illustrate all the insects known to
    be enemies of the hickory would require a large volume,
    but fortunately there are many special works published
    on the insects injurious to vegetation, and these are
    readily obtainable by all who may have occasion to consult
    their pages.</p>

<p><strong>Order</strong>, <i>Juglandaceæ</i> (Walnut family).&mdash;Medium to
    large deciduous trees with odd-pinnate leaves; leaflets

    pointed. The sexes of flowers separate (monœcious) on
    the same tree, the males in pendulous green cylindrical
    catkins two to three inches long, solitary or in pairs,
    sessile,&mdash;not stalked, as in the hickories,&mdash;issuing from
    the one-year-old twigs, and at the upper edge of the scar
    left by the falling leaf of the previous season (Fig. 73),
    showing that the male organs emanate from an aggregation
    of bud-cells in the axils of the leaves during the
    preceding summer and autumn. Female flowers terminal
    on the new growth in spring, also single, in clusters,

    stigmas. Fruit round or oblong (Fig. 74); husk thin,
    drying up without opening by seams, as in the hickories.
    Shell of nut either rough and deeply corrugated, with
    sharp-pointed ridges, or quite smooth, with an undulating,
    wavy surface, very thick in some species and thin
    in others; kernel two- or indistinctly four-lobed, united

<p><strong>History.</strong>&mdash;The common walnut, so long and
    widely known in commerce under various names, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> as Persian, English, French, Italian and European walnuts,
    also as Madeira nut, and recently Chile walnut,
    are now all believed to have descended from trees native
    of Persia, most plentiful in the province of Ghilan on
    the Caspian sea, between latitude 35° and 40°, hence the
    old Grecian name of the fruit, viz.: Persicon and Basilicon,
    or Persian Royal nut, probably because either
    introduced by the Greek monarchs, or sent to them by
    the Persian kings. Later,&mdash;according to Pliny,&mdash;the
    Greeks called the trees <i>Caryon</i>, on account of the strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> scent of the foliage, and from this name Nuttall coined
    his word, <i>Carya</i>, for our indigenous hickories, as explained
    in the preceding chapter. It should also be
    noted here that the elder Michaux, in 1782-4, was the
    first modern botanist to visit the province of Ghilan, and
    he determined, by personal investigation, that this species
    of the walnut was really indigenous to that region
    of country, along with the peach and apricot.</p>

<p>Earlier European authors claim that the walnut
    was first introduced into Italy by Vitellius (emperor)
    early in the first century of the Christian Era,&mdash;but this
    is uncertain,&mdash;the Romans giving it the name of <i>Juglandes</i>,
    or the nut of Jove or Jupiter, both being the
    same mythical personage. The nuts, at this early day,
    were highly prized, and also the wood of the tree, the
    latter being even more valuable than that of the citron
    (orange and lemon). Ovid wrote a poem about these
    nuts, entitled <i>De Nuce</i>, from which we learn that boys
    were employed to, or did of their own accord, knock off
    these nuts; and that at marriages walnuts were thrown
    by the bride and bridegroom among the children, a
    ceremony which was supposed to indicate that the
    bridegroom had left off his boyish amusements, and
    that the bride was no longer a votary of Diana, and
    it is quite probable that the French word for nuptials, <i>des nôces</i>, was derived from this ancient custom.
    The ancients also believed that walnuts possessed powerful
    medicinal properties, even to the curing of hydrophobia;
    but in these latter days they have lost most
    of their curative virtues, in the opinion of the medical
    fraternity.</p>
<p>As with the chestnut, the planting of the walnut
    extended northward into Gaul (France), hence the
    earlier name of Gaul nuts, which became corrupted into
    walnuts by the English-speaking people. The Italian
    name is <i>Noci</i>; in France, <i>Noyer</i>; and the Germans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span> with their usual habit of compounding names, call it <i>walnuss-baum</i> or walnut tree.</p>
<p>Joannis De Loureiro, in his work on the plants of
    China, &quot;Flora Cochinchinensis,&quot; published in 1790,
    claims that this Persian walnut is also a native of the
    northern provinces of China, with two other species
    which he describes (p. 573), adding, however, that one
    of these is cultivated in Cochin China, and the other is
    found wild in the mountains.</p>
<p>The wild form of this world-wide-famous nut is,
    doubtless, quite different from the varieties with which
    we are familiar, for two thousand years or more of continuous
    cultivation and selections have greatly changed
    the character of these nuts, as well as the habit of the
    trees. The nuts from the wild trees are said to have a
    rather thick shell, and to be much smaller than the best of
    the improved cultivated varieties, or very like those we
    now obtain in China and Japan. The Persian walnut,
    in its many varieties, has been planted almost everywhere
    in Europe as far north as Warsaw, but does not
    appear to have run wild and become naturalized, as with
    many other kinds of fruit and forest trees. In Great
    Britain it has probably been cultivated ever since the
    invasion of the country by the Romans, although a
    much later date is named by some of our modern horticultural
    authorities. Dodoens (1552), Gerarde (1597),
    Parkinson (1629), and other of our early authors of
    works on cultivated plants, speak of the Persian walnut
    as common in various countries of Europe, Great Britain
    included. John Evelyn, in his &quot;Sylva&quot; (1664), says:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In Burgundy, walnut trees abound where they stand,
        in the meadows of goodly lands, at sixty and a hundred
        feet distance, and so far as hurting the crop, they are
        looked upon as great preservers, keeping the ground
        warm, nor do the roots hinder the plow.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evelyn, no
    doubt, had read what Pliny had said on this point, viz.:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span> </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&quot;Even the oak will not thrive near the walnut tree;
        which, if it be true, may be owing to the interference of
        their roots in the subsoil; but it is certain that neither
        grass nor field nor garden crops thrive well under the
        walnut.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evelyn was far too good a gardener and close
    observer to fall into the error of attributing noxious
    properties to the walnut tree, although Pliny's assertion,
    which has no foundation beyond his imagination, has
    been many times repeated in these days of supposed general
    intelligence. Small plants may fail, under the
    shade of large trees, or when deprived of moisture by
    the roots of such trees, but the walnut is no exception
    to the rule; in fact, such deep-rooted kinds are less
    injurious than those with roots nearer the surface.
    Evelyn, in continuing his account of the walnut in Germany,
    says:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Whenever they fell a tree, which is only
        the old, decayed, they always plant a young one near
        him, and, in several places betwixt Hanau and Frankfort,
        no young farmer whatsoever is permitted to marry
        a wife till he bring proof that he is a father of such a
        stated number of walnut trees; and the law is inviolably
        observed to this day, for the extraordinary benefit which
        this tree affords the inhabitants.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a pity that
    some such custom could not have prevailed during the
    past century in the United States. The author from
    whom I have just quoted adds that the Bergstrasse,
    which extends from Heidelberg to Darmstadt, is all
    planted with walnuts.</p>
<p>Cold winters, however, have occasionally played
    havoc with the walnut trees in Europe, and one of these
    occurred in 1709, when the greater part of the trees
    were seriously injured, especially in Switzerland, Germany
    and France. Many trees were cut down for their
    timber, which is always in great demand for gun-stocks
    and furniture. Certain Dutch capitalists, foreseeing
    the scarcity of walnut timber, bought up all they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> procure, and years afterwards sold it at a greatly advanced
    price. In the year 1720 an act was passed in
    France to prevent the exportation of walnut timber, and
    this led to the planting of these trees more extensively
    than at any previous date; this practice has continued to
    the present time, hence the immense revenue secured
    from the exportation of these nuts. The people of the
    United States are good customers for the surplus stock
    of Europe, and will probably so continue, until we wake
    up to a sense of our folly of perpetually buying articles
    that could be readily produced at home, and at a very
    large profit.</p>
<p><strong>Persian Walnut in America.</strong>&mdash;The date of the
    first experiment in planting this nut in this country is
    now probably unknown, but the oldest tree that I have
    been able to find with anything like a satisfactory history,
    is still growing vigorously at Washington Heights,
    on Manhattan Island, near 160th street and St. Nicholas
    avenue. I gave a brief history of this noble monarch of
    its race in the <i>American Garden</i> for September, 1888,
    from which the following account is condensed:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;In 1758 Roger Morris, an English gentleman, built a spacious
        mansion on his estate, at what, in later years, became
        known as Washington Heights. His grounds
        were well laid out for that time, and many rare foreign
        trees and shrubs planted, among them several, as then
        called, English walnuts. Whether these trees were
        raised from the nuts, or plants of some size imported, is
        not now known. Mr. Morris may have procured the
        seedlings from the Prince Nursery, Flushing, L. I., for
        this famous garden was established in 1713, or forty-five
        years previous to the building of the Morris mansion
        and the planting of the grounds about it.</p>
    <p>&quot;At that period no one doubted the hardiness of the
        so-called English walnut in America, and as most of the
        nuts and trees procured for planting came from acclimated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> stock in Great Britain or the cooler region of
        Europe, success usually attended such experiments.
        Our pioneers and horticulturists fully expected that the
        trees would thrive and bear nuts in abundance, and time
        has shown that they were not mistaken, although we
        frequently see it stated at this late day, that the Persian
        walnut is not hardy north of the latitude of Washington,
        Philadelphia, or other cities south of New York.</p>
    <p>&quot;One hundred and thirty-eight years have rolled by
        since walnut trees were planted at Washington Heights,
        and at least one of the originals has escaped destruction
        and holds its head aloft, defying the tempests which
        frequently sweep over that elevated and exposed spot on
        Manhattan Island. This veritable patriarch of its race
        in America is a monster in size, its stem between four
        and five feet in diameter at the base and more than
        seventy-five feet high, with wide-spreading branches.</p>
    <p>&quot;In the summer of 1776 the Battle of Long Island
        was fought, and the American forces were compelled to
        retreat in confusion to New York, thence northward up
        the island; but when they reached Fort Washington, not
        far from the eleventh milestone on the old Albany post
        road, they made a stand and proceeded to entrench
        themselves at that place. This was in September, 1776,
        and General Washington took possession of the Morris
        mansion near by, making it his headquarters, and, as
        this was at the season when the walnuts had reached an
        edible stage, we may safely presume, from his well-known
        predilection for such delicacies, that he tested the quality
        of the Morris walnuts. One hundred and twenty
        years later I am writing this, with some fresh specimens
        of nuts before me from that same old tree.</p>
    <p>&quot;This old patriarch has cast its shade over many a
        noted person in its time, for in 1810 the Morris estate
        passed into the hands of Madame Jumel, a lady long
        famous for her hospitality and the good cheer she extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span> to the surviving patriots of the Revolution.
        From 1810 to the time of her death, 1865, Madame
        Jumel's household always had an abundance of walnuts
        from the old tree, and one of the workmen on the place
        informed me that about two cartloads was considered a
        fair annual crop.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It cannot be many years before this old tree will
    meet the same fate that has overtaken many of its
    younger contemporaries which were once growing in the
    neighborhood, for with the rush for building lots and
    the opening of new streets and avenues, trees are usually
    in the way, and in such cases even patriarchs are not
    sacred, nor do they command much respect from our
    urban population.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<div class="footnote">
    <p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Since writing the above, and while these pages are being put in
        type, accidentally I learn with regret that the old Morris walnut tree
        has been destroyed.</p>
</div>
<p>A half-century ago there was quite a large number
    of walnut trees scattered about on the northern half of
    Manhattan Island, many of these probably descendants
    of the old Morris trees, but of this nothing definite is
    now known. A number of persons whose ages permitted
    them to scan the early days of the present century,
    have assured me that in their childhood they had often
    collected walnuts from goodly sized trees on farms, from
    Harlem northward on the island. The largest number
    of Persian walnut trees planted in any one place was on
    the Tieman farm at Manhattanville, these being set out
    as roadside trees, some of which are still standing,
    although in the march of improvements they must soon
    disappear. These trees have always been noted for their
    productiveness, bearing a full crop every alternate year,
    and a lighter one in what is termed the &quot;off season.&quot;</p>
<p>While the old Morris walnut tree, and the large
    number growing on the Tieman estate, and scores of
    others scattered about New York city and its suburbs,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>have been, and many still are, living witnesses of the
    fact that varieties of the Persian walnut will thrive in
    this latitude, certain horticultural authors and essayists
    have continually asserted the contrary.</p>
<p>Mr. F. J. Scott, in his superb and voluminous work,
    &quot;Suburban Home Grounds,&quot; in speaking of this species
    of the walnut, says, p. 351: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Though greatly valued
        in England and on the continent for its beauty, as well
        as for its nuts, its want of hardiness in the Northern
        States, and lack of any peculiar beauty in the South, has
        prevented its culture to any great extent in this country.
        South of Philadelphia it may be grown with safety.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems strange language to have come from such an
    eminent authority as the late Mr. Scott, inasmuch as he
    must have passed a hundred times within sight, if not
    in the very shadow of the rows of old walnut trees growing
    at Manhattanville, when going from New York city
    to Newburgh, where he studied landscape gardening
    under the lamented A. J. Downing, and to whom the
    work from which I have quoted is dedicated. It is quite
    evident, however, that our author, like many others,
    failed to see things that should have interested him.</p>
<p>As an offset to Mr. Scott's idea of the northern
    limit for the successful cultivation of this nut, I may
    refer to the work of Mr. George Jacques, &quot;Practical
    Treatise on Fruit Trees, Adapted to the Interior of
    New England,&quot; published at Worcester, Mass., 1849.
    In referring to the European walnut, p. 238, he says: </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;It is perfectly hardy on Long Island, and to the south
        of New York, and as far north as the city of Charlestown
        in this State (Mass.), where there may be seen, in
        the enclosure of a residence on Harvard street, two fine
        trees of this kind, either of them much taller and larger
        than our large-sized apple trees. We have eaten nuts
        from these trees well ripened and fully equal to any of
        those imported. The trees often bear a crop of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> bushels.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is unnecessary to search for further proof
    to show that certain excellent varieties of the Persian
    walnut do thrive and bear abundantly in our Northern
    States; not, perhaps, in the extreme boreal borders of
    New England, nor in those of the northwest, but the
    acclimated sorts are pretty safe as far north as 42°
    of latitude, and in protected locations may crowd up a
    half degree more. I have found very productive trees
    of this nut in northern New Jersey, several in Bergen
    county, others in Passaic, and thence southward, and
    while they are few in number, they are sufficient to
    prove that this tree is adapted to the soil and climate of
    the entire State. We seldom find more than one or two
    trees in any garden, and these are probably more the
    result of accident than design, their owners seeming to
    be satisfied in possessing something in the way of a tree
    not common in the neighborhood, never thinking that
    it might be well to plant enough of such trees to have
    them become a source of revenue. The parentage of
    quite a number of these bearing trees is readily traced
    to the Morris and Tieman stock, showing that these old
    trees are of a hardy and prolific race, which are well
    worthy of perpetuation for cold climates. Very old and
    large walnut trees are reported as growing in Pennsylvania
    and other of the Middle States, but they are far
    from being numerous. It has long been claimed that
    this species of nut succeeded best in the Southern States,
    and it is probably true, especially with the tender varieties;
    but for some reason, unknown to me, they have
    not been planted there in sufficient numbers to have, as
    yet, become of any commercial importance.</p>
<p>During the past twenty-five years these nuts have
    been more extensively planted in California than elsewhere
    in the United States, and we may expect soon to
    know something definite in regard to results. Nearly
    all of the favorite French varieties have been introduced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> and are now being tested in different parts of the State,
    and it is quite likely that the greater part will succeed,
    although some of the early-blooming sorts may fail in
    localities subject to late spring frosts. Previous to the
    introduction of grafted trees of the named varieties, the
    only trees of this kind planted in California were seedlings
    raised from the common imported nuts; but I
    have no statistics at hand to determine the date of the
    first plantings of this kind.</p>
<p>Of late years there has been received, at some of
    our seaports, and especially at New York, some quite
    large consignments of walnuts from South America,
    under the name of &quot;Chile walnuts,&quot; but they are only
    varieties of the Persian raised in Chile. They are generally
    of good size, moderately thin shelled, with plump
    kernels of excellent flavor. They are in great demand
    for confectionery, and are really better for such purposes
    than the larger and fancy bleached walnuts imported
    under the somewhat general name of Grenobles, or
    French walnuts. Owing to the difference of climate,
    these Chile walnuts arrive here late in winter, or about
    the time those coming from European countries the previous
    autumn begin to become somewhat stale.</p>
<p>Of our native species of this genus (<i>Juglans</i>), the
    almost everywhere common butternut ranks first in
    flavor and general estimation, but owing to its hard,
    rough shell, and the difficulty in extracting the kernel,
    it has never become of any considerable importance,
    although usually found in our markets in limited quantities.
    Of course, it is a general favorite in the country,
    and wherever found in sufficient quantities the boys and
    girls lay up a goodly supply for winter use; and cracking
    butternuts during the long winter evenings is a
    pastime and pleasure not to be ignored nor forgotten.
    The flavor of the butternut is far more delicate, and
    better, than any of the Persian species, but the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> in extracting the rather small kernel is a serious
    objection.</p>
<p>The black walnut has a larger kernel, in proportion
    to its size, than the butternut, and it is not so difficult
    to extract when the nuts are dry, but the flavor is too
    rank for most palates, although it has often been referred
    to as excellent by the earlier botanists who visited this
    country; but it has never been considered of much value
    until quite recently, or since the manufacturers of confectionery
    discovered that heat somewhat subdued the
    rank flavor, and now many tons of the meats are annually
    consumed in candies and walnut cakes. I am credibly
    informed that cracking black walnuts and shipping
    the meats to our larger cities has become quite an extensive
    industry in several of the Middle and Western States.
    We have two other but smaller native species of the walnut
    that will be described further on, under the head
    Species and Varieties.</p>
<p><strong>Propagation of Walnuts.</strong>&mdash;The propagation of
    the walnut in the natural way, or by seed, is exceedingly
    simple, for the nuts grow readily and freely if planted
    soon after they are ripe, or any time before they become
    old and the kernels shriveled. It is, of course, best to
    plant them while fresh, but they are not at all delicate,
    and may be transported a long distance in a dry condition
    without seriously affecting their vitality. If walnuts
    are given the same care as recommended in the
    preceding pages for other kinds of nuts, so much the
    better.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"> <img src="images/fig75.jpg" alt="" title="" height="526" width="200" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._75" id="FIG._75">FIG. 75</a>. SEEDLING WALNUT.</span> </div>
<p>The seedlings of walnuts, like those of other species,
    usually produce long taproots, and if grown in a compact
    soil, these will have few small lateral fibers the first season,
    as shown in Fig. 75; but when taken up and the
    vertical main root shortened at <i>a</i>, and then replanted,
    they produce fibrous roots in abundance. The trees of
    almost any age from one to twenty years old, are not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> all difficult to make live when transplanted, provided
    the branches or tops of the trees are reduced, to correspond
    with loss of roots in digging up at the time of
    removal. It may be well to give
    a word of caution to the novice in
    nut culture about pruning nut
    trees in spring, after the sap begins
    to flow; for if done at this time
    they will bleed freely and leave
    unhealthy wounds and black, unsightly
    spots on the bark. Prune
    walnuts in summer or early in
    winter, to give time for the wounds
    to season before the buds swell in
    spring. If young trees are to be
    dug up, prune after they are taken
    from the ground, then the sap will
    not flow from the wounds. This
    is true of all deciduous trees,
    vines and shrubs. If the trees
    have few small roots when taken
    up, prune severely; but if roots
    are abundant, little pruning will
    be required. It is seldom, however,
    in transplanting walnuts,
    that the pruning need be as severe
    as recommended for the chestnut;
    in fact, having transplanted walnuts
    of various species, and of
    all ages from one to twenty years,
    without the loss of a plant, I have
    come to the conclusion that they
    are pretty safe trees to handle, in this climate, at least,
    if not elsewhere.</p>
<p>In seeking walnuts from a distance, for planting
    anywhere in the Middle or Northern States, it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> well to learn something in advance about the climate in
    which the nuts are raised; for it would be folly to send
    for either trees or nuts to a warm or semi-tropical region,
    like that of southern France or Spain, for a stock to
    cultivate in a climate as cold as that of New York, New
    Jersey, and States on the same line westward. We
    might, perchance, from such importation, secure one
    hardy plant in a hundred or thousand, but there would
    be no certainty of even this small number.</p>
<p>This idea of acclimation and adaptation of trees
    to conditions and climate should not be overlooked
    by the nut culturist, no matter from what source
    he procures his stock, whether from abroad, or some
    distant region of his own country. If it can be
    obtained from a region where it has been growing
    under conditions similar to those to which it is to
    be transferred for cultivation, then the chances of
    success will certainly be largely augmented. Acclimation
    is a slow process; in fact, too slow for us to
    expect to secure any appreciable advantages from it
    in a lifetime, but in nature we seek final results, leaving
    time out of the question.</p>
<p>In raising seedling trees we cannot expect much
    more than a reproduction of the species, and not that of
    the parent tree. Plants that have been subjected to unnatural
    conditions and surroundings, as usual under cultivation,
    are far more likely to show a wider range of variation
    in the seedlings than those growing wild in their
    native habitats; but even the latter cannot be depended
    upon to reproduce exact types from seed. In other
    words, there is nothing certain about seedling nut trees;
    the large nuts may produce trees bearing very small ones,
    the early-ripening give late ones, the tall dwarf trees
    and the precocious fruiting some of the most tardy varieties;
    and yet, with all this uncertainty, we still think
    it best to select for planting the best nuts obtainable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> <i>i. e.</i>, best and most promising for the conditions under
    which the seedlings are to be grown.</p>
<p>For the multiplication and perpetuation of choice
    varieties we must resort to artificial modes of propagation,
    mainly by budding and grafting. These modes,
    however, while the best at present known, are so difficult
    and uncertain in cool climates,&mdash;even in the hands
    of the most skilful propagators,&mdash;that grafted walnut
    trees have never been very plentiful in the nurseries of
    this or other countries with which we have commercial
    relations. In the south of France nurserymen appear to
    have been more successful in the propagation of walnuts
    by budding and grafting, than elsewhere; but in the
    northern provinces, as well as in Great Britain, we hear
    little of this mode of propagation. So difficult has this
    mode of propagating the walnut been considered in England,
    that Thomas Andrew Knight, president of the
    London Horticultural Society, early in the present century
    discouraged all attempts to propagate this tree by
    such means; but later, in a paper read before the Society
    April 7, 1818, he admits to having changed his
    mind, especially in regard to budding the walnut, and
    says:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The buds of trees of almost every species succeed
        with most certainty when inserted on the shoots of the
        same year's growth; but the walnut tree appears to
        afford an exception; possibly, in some measure, because
        its buds contain within themselves, in the spring, all
        the leaves which the tree bears in the following summer,
        whence its annual shoots cease to elongate soon after its
        buds unfold; all its buds of each season are also, consequently,
        very nearly of the same age, and long before
        any have acquired the proper degree of maturity for
        being removed, the annual branches have ceased to grow
        longer or to produce new foliage.... To obviate the
        disadvantage arising from the preceding circumstances, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span> adopted means of retarding the period of the vegetation
        of the stocks comparatively with that of the bearing
        tree: and by these means I became partially successful.
        There are, at the base of the annual shoots of the walnut
        and other trees, where these join the year-old wood,
        many minute buds which are almost concealed in the
        bark, and which rarely or never vegetate but in the
        event of the destruction of the large prominent buds
        which occupy the middle and opposite end of the annual
        wood. By inserting in each stock one of these minute
        buds and one of the large prominent kind, I had the
        pleasure to find that the minute buds took freely,
        while the large all failed without a single exception.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the above and other remarks of Mr. Knight,
    in the paper read by him, I infer that he kept the stocks
    in pots stored in a cool place in spring, until he could
    obtain shoots of the season from bearing trees, and from
    these minute undeveloped axillary buds for inserting in
    the stocks. These buds, as he informs us, are inserted
    in the wood of the preceding season, and near the summit
    or top. He does not give any directions for holding
    the buds in place, whether by waxed or plain bass ligatures;
    the former, however, would probably be preferable,
    for the purpose of excluding the air and water.</p>
<p>Some twenty years later (1838) J. C. Loudon, in
    &quot;Arboretum Britannicum,&quot; etc., refers to the propagation
    of the walnut as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Much has been written on
        the subject by French authors, from which it appears
        that in the north of France, and in cold countries generally,
        the walnut does not bud or graft easily by any
        mode; but that in the south of France and north of
        Italy it may be budded or grafted by different modes,
        with success. At Metz, the Baron de Tschoudy found
        the flute method (Fig. 76) almost the only one which he
        could practice with success. By this mode an entire
        ring of bark, containing one or more buds, is removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> from a twig on a tree to be multiplied, and transferred
        to the stock, and made to fit as shown. If the ring is
        too large, a slice may be cut off; and if too small, a
        piece of the bark of the stock may be left to fill the
        space.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both stock and parent tree must be in about
    the same condition or stage of growth when this ring
    budding is done, in order that the bark containing the
    bud may peel off freely from the wood, and this is always
    in the spring, soon after the buds
    begin to unfold and the sap is in
    motion. Loudon says that in Dauphine,
    France, young plants in the
    nurseries are budded chiefly by this
    mode, which succeeds best the closer
    the operation is performed to the collar
    of the plant; and the same is
    true in grafting, the nearer the root
    the better, as has been found by experience
    with hickories.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"> <img src="images/fig76.jpg" alt="" title="" height="411" width="200" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._76" id="FIG._76">FIG. 76</a>.
    FLUTE BUDDING.</span> </div>
<p>Charles Baltet, in his &quot;L'Art de
    Greffer,&quot; recommends grafting in the
    usual mode of crown grafting, also
    flute or ring grafting, in April or
    May, and ordinary cleft grafting close
    to the root and at the forks of the
    branches, etc. He says that the cion
    should be cut, as much as possible,
    obliquely across the pith, so that it may be exposed on
    one side only. He also advises using cions whose base
    consists of wood of two years' growth, and these furnished
    with a terminal bud. He cautions propagators
    against grafting early-growing kinds upon those of later
    vegetation. If walnuts of any of the native or foreign
    species have been successfully propagated by budding or
    grafting, at any of the nurseries in our Eastern States, it
    has not been made known in the nurserymen's catalogues.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>
<p>Michael Floy, who early in the present century had
    quite extensive grounds devoted to fruit and ornamental
    trees, near what is now the center of New York city, as
    we learn from his &quot;Guide to the Orchard,&quot; published in
    1833, claims, in this work, that the Persian walnuts
    thrive well in this country, but admits that he had never
    succeeded in grafting the trees, and with the hickories
    had no better success, although he had tried them many
    times; but he adds:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Still I do not say it is impossible
        either to bud or graft them; but there is
        something peculiar about it, for both the bud and graft
        turn black when cut, almost instantaneously. Others
        may succeed better, but let them try it before they
        affirm it upon hearsay; they may succeed very well by
        inarching.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming down to the present day, in our search for
    facts and information in regard to the propagation of
    varieties of the walnut, we may find it interesting to
    visit California, which, of all the States of the Union, is
    perhaps the best adapted to nut culture in general;
    besides, a larger number of nut trees of various kinds
    have been planted there than elsewhere in this country.
    It is in California that we find such men as Felix Gillet,
    of Nevada City, an enthusiastic propagator and cultivator
    of fruit and nut trees, and especially of the latter,
    if we may judge by his works and writings on this
    branch of horticulture,&mdash;and so far as I have been able
    to learn, he is the only nurseryman in the United States
    who has grafted walnut trees of many different varieties
    for sale.</p>
<p>In regard to modes of propagation, Mr. Gillet says
    that the common mode of shield budding, as employed
    on fruit trees, fails entirely with small walnuts from one
    to three years from the seed, and it does but seldom succeed
    even on larger stocks. When tried on large, old
    stocks, he advises removing all the wood from the inner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> side of the strip of bark on which the bud is situated,
    and at the same time have this strip not less than two
    inches long and as broad as possible. He describes his
    mode of grafting walnuts, which does not differ materially
    from those already given. That he has never attained
    any very remarkable results may be inferred from
    the following:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;We will add that the 'grafted walnuts' that we
        offer were grafted expressly for us, regardless of cost, by
        the most reliable firm to be found in the walnut district
        in France, through a process discovered several years
        ago, and which we will briefly describe for the benefit of
        people who may be inclined to try this new method of
        grafting very young walnuts.</p>
    <p>&quot;One-year-old seedlings of the size of the little finger,
        or about one-half inch in diameter at the butt, are
        selected, the root cut back short enough to permit the
        planting of the trees in pots of three inches in depth;
        the trees, previously to being potted, are grafted with
        cions exactly of the same size, whip or cleft grafting
        being used; the pots are then taken to a hot or propagating
        house, and a glass bell set over them to prevent
        the outside air getting to the grafts, the temperature
        of the house being kept day and night, at least for
        fifteen days, or till the grafting has taken, to 70° F.
        When the grafts are well taken and growing, the glass
        bells are removed, and the grafts allowed to grow three
        or four inches, before the little grafted trees are set out
        in nursery rows; it may be preferable, especially in certain
        parts of the country, to keep the trees in the
        pots till the ensuing spring. Forty to fifty per cent
        of the grafts will succeed, and it is the best that can
        be done.</p>
    <p>&quot;This mode of grafting the walnut, besides requiring
        a hothouse, needs the care of a skillful person to
        make it succeed. So are grafted the little trees that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> import from France, and that we plant in nursery rows
        and offer to the public.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For other modes of root grafting, I refer the reader
    to those recommended for the hickories, in the preceding
    chapter. Propagating walnuts by layers is practicable,
    where the small trees have been cut down to force
    out new shoots near the surface of the ground, then bent
    down and covered with soil in the usual method of layering
    woody plants.</p>
<p><strong>Planting and Pruning.</strong>&mdash;The plants will produce
    a greater number of fibrous roots if the nuts are planted
    in light, loose, but rich soil, than in a heavy, tenacious
    one; but with all kinds it is best to transplant when
    one or two years old, and cut off a portion of the taproots,
    as recommended for the hickories. When removed
    from the nursery rows for final planting, prune
    away nearly or quite all side branches, leaving only the
    terminal bud if the trees are not more than six to eight
    feet high. After final planting where the trees are to
    remain permanently, very little pruning will ever be
    required, further than to cut away branches that may
    cross each other, or to shorten some to give proper form
    to the head. No tree in cultivation requires less pruning
    than walnuts.</p>
<p>As a genus of trees the walnuts flourish best in
    deep, rich loam, rather light than heavy, and in this
    country require considerable moisture at the roots, and
    some, like the butternut, succeed best in bottomlands,
    near creeks and larger streams. If the soil is naturally
    too dry for such trees, the fault can be readily remedied
    by the use of some form of mulch applied to the surface
    of the soil around the stem after planting, renewing this
    annually, or oftener if necessary, until the trees are large
    enough to shade the ground.</p>
<p>Walnut trees, as well as the closely allied hickories,
    are well adapted for roadside planting, and when set in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> such positions are far less likely to be injured by insects
    than when planted in orchards or large groups, besides
    serving a double purpose, being ornamental as well as
    useful. They may also be planted around buildings,
    and where other and less valuable trees are generally
    grown. There are also millions of acres of rocky hill-sides
    and old fields which might be utilized for nut
    orchards, and if rather widely scattered over such land
    they would prove beneficial in shading the pasture
    grasses. First of all, however, let us have rows of these
    trees along all our country roads, after which it will be
    time enough to begin planting them elsewhere.</p>
<h3>SPECIES AND VARIETIES OF WALNUTS.</h3>
<p><strong>Native of the United States</strong> (<i>Juglans cinerea.</i> Linn.). Butternut. White Walnut.&mdash;Leaflets fifteen
    to nineteen, oblong-lanceolate and sharp-pointed, rounded
    at the base, downy, especially on the underside,
    petioles covered with viscid hairs; fruit oblong, two
    or more inches in length, with a clammy husk, not
    opening when ripe, but closely adhering to the deeply
    corrugated and rough, thick shell. Trees with wide-spreading
    branches, and of medium hight, or from forty
    to fifty feet, but in deep forests sometimes sixty to
    seventy, with stems two to three feet in diameter. A
    common tree in moist soils almost everywhere, from the
    Canadas southward to the highlands of northern Georgia,
    Alabama, and sparingly in Mississippi and Arkansas,
    and all the States bordering the Mississippi river northward
    to Minnesota. A valuable timber tree, with soft,
    light wood, much used of late for furniture and inside
    house finishing. In early times the inner bark was
    employed for making a yellow dye, also as a medicine,
    the extract being a mild cathartic, hence one of the
    specific names, <i>Cathartica</i>.</p>

<p><strong>Varieties of the Butternut.</strong>&mdash;There are to be
    found many varieties of the butternut, varying mainly
    in the size of the nuts, and only slightly in the thickness
    of the shell; but I am not aware that any of these have
    ever been propagated, all the trees in cultivation or elsewhere
    having been grown from the nuts. This nut is,
    no doubt, susceptible of great improvement, as well as
    others of the genus, and it is worthy of being experimented
    with for that purpose, especially in cold, northern
    climates, where there are few or no other kinds of
    edible nuts. Probably the most direct and surest way
    to secure improved varieties is by hybridizing, taking
    the butternut for the female parent, and the Persian
    walnut for the male. Hybrids between these two species
    are already known, and they will, no doubt, become
    more plentiful as soon as skillful horticulturists are encouraged
    to produce them. Several hybrid walnuts of
    other species are figured and described by European horticulturists,
    but, so far as known, they are mainly accidental
    productions, and not the result of any direct
    effort of man; nature, in this instance, merely giving a
    hint of the possible, leaving us to avail ourselves of the
    lesson if we feel so inclined.</p>
<p>J. Le Conte, in a list of four hundred and fifty
    plants, collected by him on the island of New York
    (Manhattan), and published in the &quot;Medical and Philosophical
    Register,&quot; Vol. II, 1812, mentions a hybrid
    walnut among the number. Dr. John Torrey, in &quot;Catalogue
    of Plants,&quot; etc., 1819, refers to this tree under
    the name of <i>Juglans hybrida</i>, and says that it is growing
    near where Eighth avenue intersects the road called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> Lake Tours, about three miles from the city, and is a
    large tree. This specimen probably disappeared long
    ago, and we have no means now of determining its origin
    or between what two species it was a hybrid.</p>
<p>Recently Prof. C. S. Sargent has discovered other
    hybrid walnuts in the neighborhood of Boston, and figured
    and described one in <i>Garden and Forest</i> for Oct.
    31, 1894. He says:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;My attention was first called to
        the fact by observing that a tree which I had supposed
        was a so-called English walnut (<i>Juglans regia</i>), in the
        grounds connected with the Episcopal school of Harvard
        college, at Cambridge, was not injured by the cold of the
        severest winters, although <i>Juglans regia</i> generally suffers
        from cold here, and rarely grows to a large size.
        This individual is really a noble tree; the trunk forks,
        about five feet above the surface of the ground, into two
        limbs, and girths, at the point where its diameter is
        smallest, fifteen feet and two inches. The divisions of
        the trunk spread slightly and form a wide, round-topped
        head of pendulous branches of unusual symmetry and
        beauty, and probably sixty to seventy feet high. A
        closer examination of this tree showed that it was hardly
        to be distinguished from <i>Juglans regia</i> in habit, in the
        character of the bark, or in the form and coloring of the
        leaves, and that the oblong nut, with its thick shell
        deeply sculptured into narrow ridges, was the slightly
        modified nut of our native butternut, <i>Juglans regia</i>.
        Two other trees with the same peculiarities were afterwards
        found. One is a large, wide-spreading specimen,
        with a trunk diameter of four feet three inches about
        two feet above the surface of the ground, and just below
        the point where it divides into three large limbs. This
        is on the grounds of Mr. Eben Bacon of Jamaica Plain,
        and is supposed to have been planted between fifty
        and sixty years ago. The other has a tall, straight
        trunk, with a diameter of three feet one inch at three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span> feet above the surface of the ground, and is growing on
        a farm near Houghton's Pond, in Milton, at the base of
        the southeastern slope of the Blue Hills.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That there should be hybrid walnuts is nothing
    strange or wonderful, and we often marvel that there
    should be so few of them in regions where two or more
    species are growing in close proximity in the same forest,
    or elsewhere, but from whence came these specimens in
    Massachusetts is somewhat of a mystery. We may
    safely conclude, however, that the hybridizing did not
    occur there, but somewhere else, and either the nuts or
    small seedling trees were introduced and planted where
    these hybrid specimens are now growing. It is possible
    that they are descendants of the old hybrid walnut tree
    of New York city, mentioned by Le Conte and Dr.
    Torrey, some one having sent nuts or seedlings to friends
    in Massachusetts, and the three trees described by Prof.
    Sargent are merely those which have survived until
    the present day, these retaining the hybrid characteristics
    of their parent. These hybrids may or may not
    possess any special economic value, but they are of considerable
    scientific interest, and for this reason alone
    are well worthy of careful preservation and extensive
    propagation.</p>
<p><i>Butternut Sugar.</i>&mdash;It has often been claimed that
    sugar can be made from the native butternut tree, and
    while it is true that the sweetish sap flows readily from
    wounds made in this tree in early spring, the amount
    and quality of sugar to be obtained from it is scarcely
    worthy of serious attention. In my boyhood days butternut
    syrup and sugar were considered as &quot;sticky jokes&quot;
    of the sugar camp.</p>

<p><strong>Hybrids in California.</strong>&mdash;Mrs. Ninetta Eames,
    writing, in the <i>American Agriculturist</i>, of new varieties
    of walnuts in California, refers to certain species and
    varieties growing in that State, as follows:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;On one of the avenues in Santa Rosa there are some
        dozen or so ornamental shade trees, which invariably
        attract the passers. It is not only that they are uncommonly
        beautiful, but that there is something unfamiliar
        about them. One unhesitatingly pronounces them
        'walnuts,' from their unmistakable likeness to both
        the English walnut and the native species found growing
        along the streams of middle and southern California.
        They are, in fact, a cross between the <i>Juglans regia</i> and <i>J. Californica</i>, the wild black walnut of this State. In
        its appearance, this magnificent hybrid is nicely balanced
        between both parents, but it is superior to either of
        them in beauty and luxuriance of foliage, and in its
        phenomenal growth. There is, indeed, but one tree,
        the eucalyptus, that grows more rapidly. In speaking
        of this quality in the new walnut, Mr. Luther Burbank
        says: 'It often excels the combined growth
        of both parents, adding twelve to sixteen feet to its
        hight in one year. Given like conditions, a budded
        six-year-old hybrid is twice as large as a black walnut

    <p>&quot;The clean cut, bright green leaves make a remarkable
        showing, being all the way from two feet to a yard
        in length, and of graceful, drooping habit (Fig. 77).
        They are sweet-scented, too,&mdash;a delightful fragrance,
        resembling that of June apples. Another admirable
        feature of this hybrid walnut is its smooth, grayish bark,
        with white marblings not unlike the Eastern sugar
        maple. The wood is compact, with lustrous, satiny
        grain, and takes an elegant polish, which gives it unmistakable
        commercial value. Like the majority of hybrids,
        though blossoming freely it yields a scant crop of nuts,
        one or two annually on a single tree, and this only after
        twelve years of persistent barrenness. The seed, when
        planted, goes back to its parent distinctiveness,&mdash;one-half
        turning out to be English walnuts and the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a><br />
        <a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> half black walnuts,&mdash;the true hybrid being only
        reproduced by grafting
        on a thrifty young <i>Juglans
        Californica</i>.</p>
    <p>&quot;Another handsome
        novelty in shade trees,
        is a hybrid from the <i>Juglans nigra</i>, or well-known
        Eastern black
        walnut, and <i>J. Californica</i> (Figs. 78 and 79).
        It makes a charming
        ornamental tree, and
        bears, in its season, a
        prolific crop of unusually
        large nuts, which have
        little value except in the
        eyes of school children.
        Several of these hybrids
        are growing in Santa
        Rosa, and present an interesting
        study to the
        pomologist.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;A still more unique
        species of the walnut
        genus is the <i>Juglans Sieboldiana</i>,
        a Japanese walnut
        which grows abundantly
        in the mountainous
        districts of the island
        of Yesso, and also in the
        more southern divisions
        of the empire. Several
        of these remarkable trees
        are to be found in the
        Kew gardens, but only one specimen is said to be growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> in America, and this has recently come into profuse
        bearing on the Burbank experimental farm, eight
        miles from Santa Rosa, California. According to good
        authority, this Japanese walnut not only attains its
        greatest perfection in this favored climate, but it thrives
        equally well in countries too cold for the common
        walnut, <i>J. regia</i>. In its wild state in Japan, the <i>Juglans
        Sieboldiana</i> (whose curious raceme of nuts is shown in
        Fig. 80) makes a wide-spreading tree about fifty feet in
        hight, with pale, furrowed bark; nuts an inch and a
        half long, with a diameter one-third less, and a kernel
        having much the
        flavor of the common
        walnut. The
        tree bearing so
        thriftily on California
        soil, suggests its
        possible value as a
        marketable nut,
        while it already furnishes
        a remarkable
        addition to horticultural
        interests.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Varieties of the
    Black Walnut.</strong>&mdash;As with
    the butternut, there are no
    varieties of the black walnut
    in cultivation; at least,
    none propagated by means
    which will insure the perpetuation of their varietal characteristics.
    It is true that there are plenty of wild varieties
    to be found, these varying widely in size and form,
    and somewhat in thickness of their shell, as well as the
    ease with which the kernels may be extracted, but none
    of these have been perpetuated by artificial means.
    Among the earliest varieties recognized by botanists,
    one was called Oblong Black Walnut, <i>Juglans nigra
    oblonga</i>, by Miller, 1754, and perhaps in earlier editions
    of the &quot;Gardener's Dictionary.&quot; He says this is from
    Virginia, and only a variety of the common black walnut.
    Marshall, in 1785, describes this &quot;black oblong
    fruited walnut,&quot; and adds: &quot;There are, perhaps, some
    other varieties.&quot; These oblong, or, more correctly
    speaking, oval nuts, often sharp-pointed at both ends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span> are rather plentiful at this time. There are rarely any
    considerable number of bushels reaching market from
    Virginia and adjacent States, among which these oval or
    oblong nuts cannot be found. I have a number before
    me measuring from one inch to one and a quarter in
    diameter, and from one and a half to nearly two inches
    in length. Other varieties found, perhaps, in the same
    lot, are broader than long, or one and seven-eighths
    inches broad, by one and one-half in vertical diameter.
    These measurements are of the cleaned shell, after the
    husks have been removed.</p>
<p>For several years a &quot;thin-shelled black walnut&quot; has
    been offered by at least two nurserymen, in whose catalogues
    they are described as &quot;with unusually thin shells,
    the kernels coming out whole.&quot; I have endeavored to
    ascertain the origin of this variety, but failed, for both
    of the nursery firms who advertised the frees for sale
    admit that they do not know from whom they obtained
    the nuts planted, or where the original tree is growing.
    As the trees offered are only seedlings, there is no certainty
    that they will produce nuts with &quot;thin shells.&quot;
    We can safely drop this supposed variety from the list
    until something definite is known about it.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Juglans Californica</span>, Watson. California Walnut.&mdash;Leaflets
    in from five to eight pairs, more or less
    downy, but sometimes smooth, oblong-lanceolate, sharp-pointed,
    narrowing upward from near the base, two to
    two and a half inches long. Male catkins much larger
    than in our Eastern species, or from four to eight inches,
    often in pairs. Fruit round, slightly compressed, three-fourths
    to one inch and a quarter in diameter; husk
    thin, slightly dotted or roughened; shell dark brown,
    very faintly sculptured (Fig. 83), almost smooth, thick,
    the kernel filling two broad cavities upon each side; edible
    and fairly good. A tree or large shrub in the vicinity
    of San Francisco and along the Sacramento (where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> it is sometimes cultivated), growing to the hight of
    forty to sixty feet, and two to four feet in diameter;
    ranging southward to Santa Barbara, and eastward
    through southern Arizona to New Mexico and Sonora
    (Thurber, &quot;Botany of California&quot;). This species has
    been considered by some botanists as only a variety of
    the next, or <i>Juglans rupestris</i>, var. <i>Major</i>, Torrey.
    Scarcely hardy in the latitude of
    New York city, except an occasional
    seedling from nuts gathered along
    the northern limits of the species,
    or from the cooler elevated regions
    of the Pacific slope. It is of no
    special value, only adding one more
    edible nut tree to the list.</p>

    deeply furrowed, the narrow grooves on
    the greater part continuous from base
    to apex, the broad edges of the ridges
    smooth, not jagged as in the butternut
    and black walnut. Kernel sweet and
    good, but so small (Fig. 84) as not to
    be worth the trouble of extracting. A small and neat tree
    twenty to forty feet high, native of the bottom lands of
    the Colorado in Texas, and throughout the western part
    of the State, extending through southern and central
    New Mexico to Arizona. In New Mexico it reaches an
    elevation of seven or eight thousand feet, though the
    climate is often severe, the temperature dropping to zero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> and below during the winter. Seedlings raised from
    nuts obtained near the northern limits of this species in
    Texas and New Mexico would probably be hardy in
    most of the Northern States, but they are scarcely worth
    cultivating for their nuts, owing to the small size and
    thick shell; but as the trees are neat and graceful they
    are worthy of a place among other useful and ornamental
    kinds. An occasional bearing tree of this Texas
    walnut may be seen in the gardens and parks of the
    Eastern States, and probably in some of the Western,
    but I have no direct information in regard to their locations
    or age.</p>

<p><strong><a name="Oriental_Walnuts." id="Oriental_Walnuts.">Oriental Walnuts.</a></strong>&mdash;How few or many species of
    the walnut are indigenous to China, Korea, Japan and
    other Oriental countries it would be very difficult to
    determine, with our present limited knowledge of the
    forests of that part of the world. The few botanists
    who have had opportunities of studying the flora of
    those regions do not agree as to names or number of
    species of the genus. Loureiro, in his &quot;Flora Cochinchinensis&quot;
    (1788), names three species as indigenous to
    China, viz.: <i>Juglans regia</i> in the northern part, but
    this is now considered very doubtful; <i>Juglans Camirium</i>,
    Rhumphius, a medium-sized, heart-shaped nut, the trees
    found in the forests, and also under cultivation; <i>Juglans
    Catappa</i>, a large forest tree in the Cochin China
    mountains, with oblong, edible nuts, with husk and
    shell of nuts of a reddish color. Many years later Siebold
    describes a Japan walnut under the name of <i>Juglans
    Japonica</i>, and still later the Russian botanist, Maxiomowicz,
    renames this, in honor of Siebold, <i>Juglans
    Sieboldiana</i>, and describes another native of Japan as <i>Juglans cordiformis</i>. But prior to any of the authors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span> named, Thunberg had described a Japan walnut under
    the name of <i>Juglans nigra</i>, probably the same as Loureiro's
    species, with reddish husk, but as this name had
    already been given to an American species it had to be
    dropped. Maxiomowicz also describes what he supposed
    to be a distinct species, found in the forests of Mandshuria
    under the name of <i>J. Mandshurica</i> (1872), but
    it is doubtful if it is anything more than one of the
    many wild forms of the species found widely distributed
    over eastern Asia. The red or black fruited walnut of
    Loureiro (<i>J. Catappa</i>), and Siebold's black walnut (<i>J.
    nigra</i>), are probably the same as the Ailantus-leaved
    (<i>J. ailantifolia</i>), recently described in Nicholson's
    &quot;Dictionary of Gardening,&quot; London, Eng., 1884, the
    origin of which is said to be uncertain. It is <i>Juglans
    Mandshurica</i>, Maxim, in Alphonse Lavallée's &quot;Catalogue
    of Arboretum Segrezianum.&quot; As described in
    this work, the young fruit is violet-red, and produced in
    long pendulous clusters, the latter being one of the
    marked characteristics of these Oriental walnuts. But
    whether we admit that there is but one or a dozen species
    of these Eastern walnuts, it cannot be of any special
    interest to the practical nut culturist, for to him their
    economic and commercial value is of more importance
    than scientific nomenclature.</p>

<p>Up to the present time we have only succeeded in
    obtaining two species of these walnuts, or perhaps only
    one species and one variety; but we certainly have two
    distinct forms, both coming from Japan, and distributed
    under the names given them by Maxiomowicz, viz.:</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Juglans Sieboldiana</span> (Siebold Walnut).&mdash;Leaflets
    sessile, usually fifteen, five to seven inches long, oblong-pointed,
    thin, soft, downy, serratures very shallow, pale
    green above and somewhat lighter beneath; footstalks
    densely clothed with clammy hairs; fruit in long pendulous
    clusters of a half dozen to a dozen, one and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> half inches or more long by a little more than one inch
    broad in the middle; husk thin, downy or clammy; nut
    somewhat compressed, the point usually bending to one
    side; shell smooth, with two shallow grooves from base
    upward on the sides opposite to the sharp, prominent
    ridges at the seams of the two lobes, the shell ending in
    a strong, sharp point (Fig. 85). The shell is very hard
    and thick; the kernel small, sweet, oily, resembling in
    taste our common butternut; tree a rapid and stocky
    grower, the coarse shoots and
    large leaves resembling those of
    the Ailantus tree at first, but
    soon spreading branches appear,
    forming an open, roundish head.
    The seedlings, as raised here, are
    abundantly supplied with small
    fibrous roots, which insures
    transplanting with safety. Apparently
    perfectly hardy in our
    Northern States, as I have heard
    no complaints of winter-killing
    of the young trees, although they are now widely distributed
    and in considerable numbers, but none, so far
    as I have been able to learn, have reached a bearing age
    here in the North.</p>
<p>Mr. P. C. Berckmans, of Augusta, Ga., in writing
    me under date of Dec. 3, 1894, says:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Last year we
        fruited <i>Juglans Sieboldiana</i> trees four years from the
        seed. Fruit was produced in long clusters, and trees
        exceedingly ornamental, but this year these same trees
        were killed to the ground on the 26th of March, after
        they had set a crop of fruit and made a young growth of
        more than twelve inches. This untimely frost may not
        happen again in years, but it goes to show that many
        varieties of trees which are considered hardy further
        north, are sometimes destroyed here by spring frosts.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
<p>As these Japanese and Chinese walnuts are natives
    of cold climates they may be better adapted to the Northern
    than Southern States, but there is no locality entirely
    exempt from late spring frosts, as most farmers
    and fruit growers learned to their cost the past season.
    There can be little doubt of this species of walnut being
    the one described by Rhumphius under the name of <i>J.
    Camirium</i>, and more fully later by Loureiro, as already
    noted; but having come to us from Japan as Siebold's
    walnut, this name will answer as well as any other, even
    if it is not the proper one.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"> <img src="images/fig86.jpg" alt="" title="" height="291" width="200" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._86" id="FIG._86">FIG. 86</a>. JUGLANS
    CORDIFORMIS.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Juglans cordiformis</span>, Maxim.&mdash;In foliage and
    growth of tree this is almost, if not absolutely, identical
    with the last; the difference observed
    is in the nuts, which are also produced
    in pendulous clusters. The
    form of the nut is almost round
    (Fig. 86), rather blunt-pointed, but
    the shell is deeply and unevenly furrowed,
    and indented somewhat like
    our black walnut; the ridges, however,
    are not as sharp. The specimens
    I have received from various
    sources are not as large as the Siebold,
    and the shell not quite as thick, but the kernel is
    small. I may note here that there appears to be some
    confusion in regard to this variety or species, for in several
    nurserymen's catalogues this form of nut is figured
    as Siebold's, and the one that I have described under
    that name is called <i>Cordiformis</i>. The specimens received
    from California, Japan, and also from Mr. Berckmans,
    correspond with the names here given, but further
    investigations may show that they should be reversed.
    The one I have received as <i>Cordiformis</i> is, doubtless,
    the nut described by Loureiro as <i>J. Catappa</i>, as an
    ovate-oblong nut, with a fibrous, leathery, reddish husk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>
<p>While I do not suppose that these Oriental walnuts
    will ever become of any considerable commercial value,
    they are worth planting for shade and ornamental trees.
    They are rather precocious, coming into bearing at an
    early age, and the nuts are not only edible, but will
    always be an acceptable addition to the unimportant
    although agreeable household supplies.</p>

<p>This species has been in cultivation many centuries,
    and in different countries and climates, and under such
    variable conditions that many of the varieties
    have departed widely from the normal
    type. There are now an almost innumerable
    number of varieties, varying greatly in
    size and form. Some are not larger than a
    good-sized pea, as seen in the &quot;Small
    Fruited Walnut&quot; (Fig. 87), while others are nearly as
    large as a man's fist, as in the thick-shelled or &quot;Gibbous
    Walnut&quot; (Fig. 92), while in others the nut is greatly
    elongated, as in the &quot;Barthere Walnut&quot; (Fig. 88), and
    hundreds of other intermediate forms. There are also
    varieties that bloom early in spring, others late. Some
    are very hardy, others quite tender in cold climates.
    There are also dwarf and tall-growing, as well as the
    precocious and tardy fruiting varieties. But very few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span> of these have ever been cultivated in our Eastern
    States, consequently little is known of their value
    here; but more may be in the near future, when our
    horticulturists and farmers begin to plant nut trees as
    freely as they have other kinds, or are awakened to the
    fact that such trees can be made a source of pleasure
    and profit.</p>
<p>Here in the Northern States our main dependence
    for hardy and productive trees of this species will be
    upon seedlings or cions from those acclimated specimens
    which have already been thoroughly tested and found to
    be both hardy and prolific. There are plenty of these,
    as I have stated elsewhere, and they are well worthy of
    attention and multiplication until something better is
    produced or discovered. In the meantime, the most
    promising European varieties could be imported and
    tested, although it is not probable that those originating
    in southern France and Italy would be of much value
    for planting in the latitude of New York city or north
    of it, but south of this line the chances of success
    would be somewhat greater; and to escape injury from
    late spring frosts, the more elevated regions are preferable
    to the lower and warmer anywhere in the Southern
    States. In anticipation of the question being asked, I
    will say that, at present, I do not know of any nurseryman
    in the Eastern States who propagates or imports
    named varieties of walnuts for sale. Of course, seedlings
    of these are offered, but it is well known that there
    is but a remote chance of these coming true from seed.
    Even the little dwarf French walnut <i>Præparturiens</i>, or
    Early Prolific, cannot be depended upon to produce
    dwarf or early bearing trees beyond the first generation
    from the nut, and these must be the product of grafted
    trees, to insure this much. The following list contains
    the names of only a few of the most noted varieties, the
    greater part having originated in Europe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Barthere walnuts.</span> See Fig. 88.&mdash;A very long
    nut, pointed at both ends. Shell thin; kernel large and
    of excellent flavor.
    Named
    after M. Barthere,
    a horticulturist
    of
    Toulouse,
    France, who
    discovered it
    growing among
    a number of
    other trees; consequently, its origin
    is a mystery. M. Barthere says that
    it is very productive, and even the
    seedlings of this variety
    begin to bear
    very early.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chaberte.</span>&mdash;An
    old standard
    French variety, of
    an oval shape; medium
    size, with
    very full and rich
    flavored kernel
    (Fig. 89).  The
    tree buds and blooms late, therefore especially valuable
    in localities where late spring frosts are likely to occur.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chile walnut.</span>&mdash;This name is given, in a general
    way, to all the walnuts received in our markets from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> South America. The nuts are usually of good size, with
    a dark grayish shell; thin but firm, with plump kernels
    of excellent flavor. These nuts arrive in February and
    March. Many of the Chile walnuts have three valves
    (Fig. 90), instead of the normal two. Such freaks are
    occasionally found among the European varieties, also
    in the native hickories, but these tri-valved nuts appear
    to be very abundant among the Chile walnuts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cluster walnut</span>. <span class="smcap">Racemosa or Spicata</span>.&mdash;Described
    by Mr. Gillet as a variety of the Persian walnut,
    producing medium, thin-shelled nuts in long clusters of
    from eight to twenty-eight. He also says that he introduced
    it into this country, but from whence we are not
    informed. Lavellée (1877) records it as a variety of <i>J.
    regia</i>, under the name
    of <i>racemosa</i>, giving
    its synonym as <i>Juglans
    Californica</i> of
    the horticulturists.
    I have not found it
    mentioned elsewhere.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;"> <img src="images/fig91.jpg" alt="" height="405" width="430" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._91" id="FIG._91">FIG. 91</a>. CUT-LEAVED WALNUT.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Cut-leaved
    walnut.</span>&mdash;A variety
    with deeply cut
    leaves; very ornamental,
    as seen in
    Fig. 91. Nuts quite small, but of good quality.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Franquette.</span>&mdash;Another old standard French variety,
    with large, elongated-oval nuts with a distinct point.
    Shell thin; kernel large, and of rich flavor. The tree
    blooms late; valuable for planting in the South.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gant or Bijou walnut.</span>&mdash;A remarkable variety
    on account of its extraordinary size. The shell is thin,
    with rather deep furrows, those of the largest size being
    made into ladies' companions, where to stow away gloves
    or handkerchiefs, hence the name &quot;Gant&quot; walnut.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> The kernel, though, does not correspond to the size of
    the shell (Gillet).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gibbous walnut</span> (Fig. 92).&mdash;This is a very large
    variety, supposed to be a hybrid, raised in France many
    years ago. It is of little value, as the shell is very thick
    and kernel small.
    Valuable mainly for
    its immense size.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"> <img src="images/fig92.jpg" alt="" title="" height="492" width="400" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._92" id="FIG._92">FIG. 92</a>. GIBBOUS WALNUT.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Kaghazi.</span>&mdash;This
    is supposed to
    be a variety of the
    Persian walnut, of
    fair size, with a very
    thin shell. The tree
    blooms very late in
    spring, and for this
    reason is recommended
    for localities
    where there is danger
    from injury by
    frost. The tree is
    said to be a very
    rapid grower, and much more hardy than the general
    run of varieties of this species. I have been unable to
    learn its origin, but it has been planted quite extensively
    in California, and some of our Eastern nurserymen
    are offering the seedling trees for sale, but whether they
    will possess the merits of the original or not must be
    determined by experience.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Large-fruited Præparturiens.</span>&mdash;A sub-variety
    of the Præparturiens, originating with Mr. Felix Gillet
    of California.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Late Præparturiens.</span>&mdash;Also originated with Mr.
    Gillet. Valuable because the trees bloom late in spring.
    Nuts described as of medium size, but with full kernels
    of excellent quality.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mayette.</span>&mdash;Very large (Fig. 93), with a light-colored
    shell of moderate thickness. Kernel plump, readily
    extracted whole, as shown in Fig. 94, sweet, and a
    rich, nutty flavor. Tree blooms late and is very productive.
    An old and standard French variety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mesange or Paper-shell.</span>&mdash;This nut has the
    thinnest shell of any variety known; it derives its name
    of Mesange from a little lark of that name, that goes to
    the kernel through the tender shell. Tree very productive,
    and the kernel quite rich in oil. We do not, however,
    recommend the growing of this variety for market,
    on account of the thinness of the shell, which breaks off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span> too easily in handling the nuts, or even when they drop
    on the ground (Felix Gillet).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Meylan Walnut.</span>&mdash;A French variety that originated
    near the little village of Meylan, in the vicinity
    of which it is quite extensively cultivated for home
    use and export.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Octogona.</span>&mdash;Of uncertain origin, but very much
    resembles one of the Oriental species in the form and
    sculpture of the shell (Fig. 95). The shell is also very
    thick, as shown in the cross section (Fig. 96). Of no
    special value.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Parisienne Walnut.</span>&mdash;Although this was named
    for the city of Paris it did not originate there, but in
    the South of France. It is a
    large and rather broad variety,
    with a firm but thin shell (Fig.
    97) and excellent flavored kernel.
    It is reported that this
    variety succeeds in California,
    also in the South wherever
    tried. The trees leaf out late
    in spring and are rarely injured
    by frosts, and are remarkably productive.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Præparturiens.</span> Precocious Dwarf Prolific.&mdash;A
    French variety of a dwarf habit, and the plants noted
    for bearing when very young. A correspondent of <i>The
    Garden</i> (London, Eng.), referring to this variety some
    years ago, says:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;It is precocious on account of the
        singular and exceptional fact that it is born almost an
        adult; in fact, it is nothing uncommon to see a tree in
        its third year bearing excellent fruit.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He does not say,
    however, whether he refers to seedlings or grafted
    plants, but we may presume the latter or those raised
    from layers, for cultivators who have experimented with
    seedlings have found that they possess a strong tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span> to revert to the original or tree form. This may not
    show itself very strongly in the first generation if the
    nuts are obtained from grafted trees of some age, but in
    the second and third generation the early-fruiting and
    dwarf are usually entirely lost. The only certain way of
    securing the true variety is by grafting or layering, but
    it is to be feared that very few trees propagated by these
    modes are in cultivation, at least in the Eastern States,
    although nurserymen have been offering Præparturiens
    walnut trees in their catalogues during the past fifty
    years. In one now before me, published in New York
    city in 1844, trees of this walnut are offered at one dollar
    each, or about what is charged for seedlings at the
    present time. As nothing is said in the catalogues about
    the mode of propagation, we infer that they are seedlings,
    as grafted trees would be worth more than one
    dollar. The nuts of this dwarf
    walnut are of medium size, thin-shelled
    and of excellent flavor;
    valuable for gardens of limited
    extent.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Serotina.</span> Late Walnut, St.
    John Walnut.&mdash;A very peculiar
    sort, inasmuch as it is the latest
    of all to bud and bloom in spring,
    and yet it pushes forward so rapidly
    that the nuts are ripe with
    others in the fall. They are of medium size (Fig. 98),
    with a rather hard shell, but the kernel is plump and
    good flavored. The tree is very productive, and sure to
    escape late spring frosts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vilmorin.</span>&mdash;This is claimed to be a hybrid between
    some variety of <i>J. regia</i> and our native black walnut, <i>J. nigra</i>. Scarcely known outside of France.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vourey.</span>&mdash;A new and splendid variety raised near
    Vourey, a small town in southeast France. It has much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> the same shape and qualities of the Parisienne walnut
    (Gillet).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Variegated walnut.</span>&mdash;A handsome variety, with
    young branches covered with dark-green bark spotted
    with gray, and often striped longitudinally with yellow.
    The leaves resemble those of the common walnut; the
    fruit is of a light yellowish-green streaked with darker
    green, and reminds one closely of certain varieties of
    pears which, in common with this variety, frequently
    have their young branches striped in a similar manner.
    Propagated by grafting or layers. (<i>The Garden.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Weeping walnut.</span>&mdash;A tree with pendulous twigs
    and branches. Quite ornamental, but not especially
    valuable for its fruit. Hardy in England.</p>
<p>In addition to those described, there are a large
    number of varieties, which may be worth importing
    and testing in this country, by those who may feel
    inclined to make experiments with these nuts. Probably
    some of those highly extolled by earlier writers are
    now lost, but this cannot be determined until a careful
    search through the old European gardens has
    been made.</p>
<p>Among the early-fruiting or precocious varieties we
    find an account of one raised by Anthony Carlisle, of
    England, as recorded in a paper read at a meeting of the
    Horticultural Society of London, March 3, 1812. Mr.
    Carlisle planted six nuts in March, 1802, these having
    been received from Mr. Thomas Wedgewood of
    Blandford. Six years later, or in 1808, one of the seedlings
    bore and matured ten walnuts, and the next season
    (1809) upwards of fifty, and in 1810 one hundred and
    twelve, the tree at that age being nineteen feet seven
    and one-half inches high. Another variety, under the
    name of Highflyer walnut, is described in the Transactions
    of the same society, Vol. IV, 1822, p. 517. The
    nuts sent to the society were grown in the town of Thetford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span> and are described as a long oval, with a shell so
    very thin that the slightest pressure of the fingers
    crushes it. I find that this Highflyer walnut is mentioned
    in the recently published &quot;Dictionary of Gardening,&quot;
    but whether obtainable in English nurseries or
    not we are left in doubt.</p>
<p>I refer to these English varieties mainly to show
    that some of the very best and thinnest-shelled walnuts
    have been grown in cool climates, and are not confined
    entirely to the warm or semi-tropical, as many persons
    seem to suppose and even claim to be the fact. It is
    principally from these English walnuts, as they are usually
    termed, that our hardy old-bearing trees, referred
    to elsewhere, have been produced, and, doubtless, many
    more will be, when we begin to pay some attention to
    this very valuable nut. It is also quite likely that when
    our horticulturists look about for choice acclimated
    varieties for propagation, they will be found right here
    in the grounds of next-door neighbors, and there may be
    no necessity of sending to Europe or elsewhere for either
    nuts or trees.</p>
<p>At present there is much confusion and uncertainty
    in regard to the identity and nomenclature of both species
    and varieties of the walnut, and it must remain so
    until they are collected from all countries and climes, of
    which they are either native or into which they have
    been introduced, and when so collected, and fruiting
    specimens produce, it will not be difficult to classify
    and determine their synonyms. This will be an undertaking
    scarcely to be expected of the individual nut culturist,
    but is within the legitimate line of the arboretum,
    and of public botanical gardens located in both cold and
    warm climates, thereby securing a division of labor, and
    at the same time avoiding the uncertainty of trying to
    produce practical results under uncongenial conditions
    and surroundings.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>
<p><strong>Husking Walnuts.</strong>&mdash;The husks of nearly all the
    varieties of the Persian and Oriental walnuts part from
    their shells freely when fully ripened and dried, but in a
    few varieties the husks are rather persistent, requiring
    force and friction for their removal. This may be accomplished
    by placing them in bags and shaking, or in
    barrels and rolling, until the nuts are scraped clean.
    But the better way, where there is any considerable
    quantity of nuts to be operated upon, is to take a strong
    barrel or cask, and so arrange it on standards that it
    can be rapidly revolved with a crank attached to one
    end. Of course, the cask must have its two heads left
    in place, and an opening made in the side to admit the
    nuts and remove them when cleaned. Almost any man
    handy with tools can make such a cleaner and polisher
    in a few hours, and if stored in a dry place it will last
    for several years. With butternuts and black walnuts
    the husks are much tougher, and they should be thrown
    into heaps in the open air, and turned over occasionally
    until the husks become softened sufficiently to permit
    of their removal, in case they are to be sent to market.
    Ordinary threshing machines may be used for cleaning
    the husks from black walnuts, by removing about one-half
    the teeth, or enough to allow the nuts to pass
    through without breaking their shells.</p>
<p>Most of the hickories drop from the husk, leaving
    the nut clean; but in some varieties of the pecan the
    inner part of the husk adheres rather tenaciously, and
    they sell better if cleaned; besides, some have rather
    rough and thick shells, and a little scraping and polishing
    adds much to their appearance. The revolving cask,
    either worked by hand or other power, is an excellent
    implement for preparing these nuts for market, and if
    the husk is very persistent, a little dry sand thrown in
    will aid in cleaning and polishing. Sometimes these
    nuts are subjected to what is called the soapstone polish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> leaving the shells very smooth, with a greasy feel. The
    French walnuts, which are extensively imported under
    the general name of Grenoble walnuts, are usually
    bleached with sulphur before they are shipped, and
    while this adds nothing to the quality of the kernel, the
    sulphur is an excellent insecticide and fungicide, and
    may be of some use on that account; but otherwise it is
    likely to be more injurious than beneficial. As bleaching
    both walnuts and almonds is often insisted upon by
    dealers, I give the process suggested by Director Hilgard,
    of the California Agricultural Experiment Station, which
    he believes will prove more satisfactory than the one
    usually employed, and is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>&quot;The nuts, placed in small baskets (such as the
        Chinese use for carrying), are dipped for about five minutes
        in a solution containing to every fifty gallons of
        water six pounds of bleaching powder and twelve pounds
        of sal soda. They are then rinsed with a hose, and
        after draining, again dipped into another solution containing
        one per cent of bisulphite of lime; after the
        nuts have assumed the desired tint, they are again rinsed
        with water and then dried. Instead of the second dipping,
        the nuts may be sulphured (fumigated) for ten or
        fifteen minutes. The cost of fifty gallons of chlorine
        dip will be about forty cents; the same bulk of the bisulphite
        dip, probably considerably less. The time occupied
        in handling one batch (two dips) is from twelve to
        fifteen minutes.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Insect Enemies.</strong>&mdash;The walnut is attacked by the
    same kinds of insects that infest the hickories, with,
    perhaps, a few exceptions; as, for instance, the bark
    beetles and the nut weevils. The leaves appear to be
    more or less acceptable food for the caterpillars that
    feed on the hickories, and the same insecticides and
    means employed for destroying these pests on one will
    answer for the other.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a><br />
    <a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<p>The caterpillars of some of the smaller kinds of
    moths are, as a rule, far more destructive to the leaves
    than the larger, and their ravages often escape notice
    until it is too late for the use of preventives, or for their
    destruction with insecticides.</p>
<p>Ever since I became connected with the New York
    city press, some thirty odd years ago, scarcely a season
    has passed during which one or more specimens of the
    Regal walnut caterpillar (<i>Citheronia regalis</i>), shown in
    Fig. 99, have not been received from some correspondent
    who had found them crawling down the stem or on the
    ground near a walnut tree. Such a large caterpillar
    would naturally attract the attention of almost any person,
    but to the timid its appearance is exceedingly ferocious
    and repulsive, while to the entomologist it is a
    beautiful and interesting creature, and far more likely
    to be handled with care than injured. This caterpillar
    is of a green color, and transversely banded across each
    of the rings with pale blue. The head and legs are of
    an orange color, also the long spine or horns, with the
    points tipped with black. It is certainly very formidable
    in appearance, but perfectly harmless, and may be
    handled with impunity. The parent moth (Fig. 100)
    has fore wings of an olive color, ornamented with small
    yellow spots and veined with red lines. The hind wings
    are orange-red, with two large irregular yellow patches
    before, and a row of wedge-shaped olive colored spots
    between the veins behind. Although this insect appears
    to be widely distributed over the country, and the caterpillars
    feed on the walnuts and occasionally on the
    hickory, it has never been known to be sufficiently numerous
    to attract any special attention.</p>

<h3>MISCELLANEOUS NUTS&mdash;EDIBLE AND OTHERWISE.</h3>
<p>In the following list of plants there are a few that
    in no way can be considered as related to the true nut-bearing
    trees and shrubs; but as the word &quot;nut&quot; has
    been attached as a prefix or affix in commerce, or elsewhere,
    they are admitted, even if for no other purpose
    than to designate their true position in the vegetable
    kingdom. For convenience, they are recorded in alphabetical
    order, the most familiar of the common names&mdash;where
    there are more than one&mdash;being given precedence,
    the botanical or scientific following, with a brief description,
    as my limited space will not permit of anything
    more extended.</p>
<p>It is not claimed that this catalogue of nuts is complete,
    but it is probably as near it as any heretofore
    compiled and published, and it may serve as the
    basis for a better and more extended one at some future
    time.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Acorn, or oak nut.</span>&mdash;The fruit of the oak, Quercus
    (<i>Cupuliferæ</i>), monœcious, evergreen and deciduous
    trees and shrubs, with alternate and simple straight-veined
    leaves. A very large genus, of about two hundred
    and fifty species, mainly in the temperate region of
    the northern hemisphere. There are some forty species
    native of the United States. The nuts are, on the
    whole, rather too harsh and bitter flavored to be esteemed
    or considered edible by civilized nations at the
    present day, but in former times some of the oak nuts
    were often an important article among the garnered food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span> of the household. They were used&mdash;and are still, in
    some countries&mdash;boiled, roasted, and even ground and
    made into bread and cakes. They have also been used
    as a substitute for coffee, and for malt in making beer.
    Strabo says that in the mountains of Spain the inhabitants
    ground their acorns into meal, and Pliny affirms
    that in his time acorns were brought to the table with
    the dessert, in Spain. Every student of English history
    is well aware of the importance of the acorn, not only
    as food for man, in Great Britain, in the time of the
    Druids, and later, but also for feeding swine, deer, and
    other wild and domesticated animals. But with the
    advance of civilization and the production of better
    food, the oak nut ceased to be classed among the important
    culinary supplies. There are, however, a few species
    of the oak yielding nuts fairly edible in their raw
    state, and these are much improved by roasting. The
    best of those among our native species are to be found
    in the varieties of the white oaks of the North, and in
    the evergreen (<i>Quercus virens</i>) of the Southern States.
    But with so many far superior species of edible nuts, it
    is very doubtful if any of the oaks will ever be cultivated
    for their fruit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Australian_chestnut." id="Australian_chestnut.">Australian chestnut.</a></span>&mdash;The seeds of a large tree,
    native of Australia, the <i>Castanospermum australe</i>, the
    name of the genus being derived from <i>Kastanon</i>, chestnut,
    and <i>sperma</i>, a seed, because the seeds resemble, in
    size and taste, the common chestnut. But the tree
    belongs to the bean family (<i>Leguminosæ</i>), and the seeds
    are produced in large, long pods. They are about an
    inch and a half broad, somewhat flattened, and of the
    color of a chestnut when ripe. They are roasted and
    eaten by the natives, but are rather unpalatable to those
    who have been accustomed to something better in the
    way of edible nuts. These seeds are also known as
    &quot;Moreton Bay chestnuts.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Australian_hazelnut." id="Australian_hazelnut.">Australian hazelnut.</a></span>&mdash;The fruit of <i>Macadamia
    ternifolia</i> (<i>Proteaceæ</i>). There are two species, both
    evergreen trees or tall shrubs confined to eastern Australia.
    The fruit is a kind of drupe with a fleshy exterior,
    enclosing a hard shelled nut, not unlike a small
    walnut. The kernel, when mature, has a rich and
    agreeable flavor, much like but richer than the hazelnut,
    hence one of its local names, for it is also known as
    &quot;Queensland nut.&quot; This nut tree would probably
    thrive in southern Florida, and in the warmer parts of
    California.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ben nut.</span>&mdash;Fruit of <i>Moringa aptera</i> (<i>Moringeæ</i>).
    Small, unarmed trees; only three species in the order,
    these inhabiting tropical Asia, northern Africa and the
    West Indies. The one producing the ben nuts grows
    from fifteen to twenty feet high, and is found in upper
    Egypt, Syria and Arabia. The seeds,&mdash;or nuts, as they
    are called,&mdash;are produced in capsules or seed-pods about
    a foot long, and while not edible, an oil is expressed
    from them which is largely used in the manufacture of
    perfumery, and known in commerce as ben oil. Another
    species, the <i>M. pterygosperma</i>, or winged-seeded Moringa,
    is known as the horse-radish tree, the bark of the
    roots being used as a substitute for horse-radish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Betel nut or pinang.</span>&mdash;The fruit of a lofty palm, <i>Areca Catechu</i> (<i>Palmaceæ</i>). A native of Cochin China,
    the Malayan Peninsula, and adjacent islands. A slender-stemmed
    palm, with regular pinnate leaves and long,
    narrow leaflets. The fruit is produced on an erect,
    fleshy spike, each fruit about the size of a hen's egg,
    with a thick, fibrous rind or husk, enclosing a hard nut
    somewhat like an ordinary nutmeg. These are used by
    being cut into small pieces or slices, then rolled up in a
    leaf of the betel pepper (<i>Piper betel</i>), a little lime sprinkled
    over it, and then chewed or held in the mouth, as
    practiced by those who use tobacco for chewing. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> habit of chewing the betel nut is said to be almost universal
    among the Malayan races, all carrying a box containing
    the nut leaf and lime. These nuts are shipped
    in large quantities to countries where they do not grow,
    and the habit of chewing them has spread enormously,
    of late years, and is likely to increase, as it has with
    tobacco; and the effect upon the users is said to be
    very similar, although some authorities claim that the
    betel is the most injurious of the two, having a far more
    deleterious effect upon the teeth and gums. But this
    may be due to the use of the lime. Travelers in countries
    where these nuts are in common use tell wonderful
    tales about the invigorating effects of the betel, and how
    their assistants and followers are enabled, by its use, to
    perform the most exhausting labor for days at a time,
    which, without it, would be impossible. We have no
    doubt that the users of tobacco will claim just as much
    for this narcotic weed, and probably could produce as
    many trustworthy witnesses in support of it. The betel
    is, like tobacco, a narcotic stimulant, and causes giddiness
    in persons unaccustomed to it, excoriates the
    mouth, and is so burning that Western nations will be
    slow to adopt this Eastern habit.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Bladder nut.</span>&mdash;A rather inappropriate name for
    the seed pods and small seeds of one of our common
    large deciduous shrubs, the <i>Staphylea trifolia</i>. It is
    sometimes planted for ornament. The small white
    flowers are produced in hanging racemes, succeeded by
    large bladdery pods, hence its common name.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Brazil_nut." id="Brazil_nut.">Brazil nut.</a></span>&mdash;The fruit of <i>Bertholletia excelsa</i>, a
    lofty tree of the myrtle family (<i>Myrtaceæ</i>). The tree
    attains a height of from one hundred to one hundred
    and fifty feet, with stems three to four feet in diameter.
    The leaves are broad, smooth, and about two feet long,
    rather thick, and of the texture of leather. The fruit
    is produced mainly on the uppermost branches, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span> globular, four to six inches in diameter, with a brittle
    husk on the outside, and within this a hard, tough,
    woody shell, fully one-half inch thick, containing a large
    number of the closely packed, three-sided, rough nuts,
    about an inch and a half to two inches or over in length,
    as seen in Fig. 101. The kernels are very white, solid
    and oily. When mature the fruit falls entire, and the
    natives of the country collect them, splitting the shells
    to obtain the nuts. An occasional entire fruit is sent to
    other countries, as a curiosity,
    or for the cabinet of some botanist.
    The Brazil nut is not
    only indigenous to Brazil, but
    also of Guiana, Venezuela (forming
    immense forests on the Orinoco,
    where they are called
    Juvia), and southward on the
    Rio Negra and in the valley
    of the Amazon. In fact, the
    supply appears to be inexhaustible;
    the only difficulty is in
    getting the nuts from the forests
    to some point where they
    can be shipped out of the
    country. The principal export
    is from Para, but there are
    many smaller cities and towns
    where a load of these nuts may be obtained on short
    notice. A very superior oil may be obtained from the
    nuts, by pressure, but the principal use for them is for
    desserts and confectionery. They are always abundant
    in our city markets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bread nut.</span>&mdash;The fruit of a large tree, the <i>Brosimum
    Alicastrum</i>, of the bread fruit family (<i>Artocarpaceæ</i>),
    native of the West Indies, but best known in
    Jamaica. The botanical authorities disagree in regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span> to this species, some claiming that it is a large tree, with
    wood similar to mahogany; others that it is only a small
    shrub, only five or six feet high. It has lance-shaped
    leaves, male and female flowers in globular heads, and
    usually on separate trees. The fruit is about the size of
    a plum, containing one seed or nut, which is only edible
    after roasting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Candle Nuts.</span>&mdash;A small evergreen tree, the <i>Aleurites
    triloba</i> of the spurgewort family (<i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>).
    It is a native of most warm countries of the East: India,
    Malay, southern Japan, and nearly all the islands of the
    Pacific ocean, and in some of these it is cultivated for
    the fruit, which is about two inches in diameter. In
    the center there is a hard nut, very oily, with the flavor
    of the walnut. The oil obtained from these nuts is in
    common use among the natives of the Polynesian islands.
    In the Hawaiian group the kernels are strung on a
    small, dry stick, which serves the purpose of a wick,
    and then one end lighted, as with an ordinary tallow
    or wax candle, hence probably the common name of
    candle nut. These nuts are said to be used in the
    same way in India. Large quantities of oil is also
    expressed from them and used for various purposes,
    and occasionally small quantities are exported to European
    countries.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cape chestnut.</span>&mdash;The name of a beautiful evergreen
    ornamental tree, native of south Africa, and recently
    introduced into European gardens from the Cape
    of Good Hope, hence its common, and its specific scientific
    name, <i>Calodendron capense</i>. It belongs to the
    Rue family (<i>Rutaceæ</i>). The flowers are red, produced
    in long terminal racemes, the tree growing about forty
    feet high, and said to be one of the finest trees of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span> part of Africa. It is now under trial in Florida. Why
    called a chestnut I have been unable to discover.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"> <img src="images/fig102.jpg" alt="" height="446" width="350" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._102" id="FIG._102">FIG. 102</a>. THE CASHEW NUT.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap">Cashew nut.</span>&mdash;A large shrub or small tree, native
    of the West Indies, and for this reason often referred to
    as the &quot;Western Cashew,&quot; or <i>Anacardium occidentale</i>.
    It belongs to the Terebinth family (<i>Anacardium</i>), consequently
    is closely related to our native poison sumachs
    (<i>Rhus</i>). The tree is an evergreen, with entire feather-veined
    leaves; flowers of a reddish color, very small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> sweet-scented, and produced in terminal panicles. The
    fruit is kidney-shaped, and borne on a fleshy receptacle,
    and when ripe of reddish or yellow color. The nut
    proper is enclosed in a leathery covering, consisting of
    two layers, between which is deposited a thick, caustic,
    oily substance, exceedingly acrid; but this is eliminated
    by heat, so that when the kernels are roasted they have
    a pleasant flavor and are highly esteemed for dessert.
    Some care is required in roasting these nuts, as the
    fumes given off during this operation cause inflammation
    of the eyes. The nuts also yield an excellent oil,
    very similar to the best olive oil. Although originally
    found only in the West Indies, this nut is now widely
    distributed throughout the tropical countries of the
    East; in fact, naturalized in all hot climates, and is also
    under trial in southern Florida.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Caucasian walnut</span>. <span class="smcap">Winged walnut</span>.&mdash;The
    winged fruit of <i>Pterocarya fraxinifolia</i>, also known as <i>P. Caucasica</i> of nurserymen's catalogues. It belongs to
    the walnut family (<i>Juglandaceæ</i>), and is a tree growing
    thirty to forty feet high, somewhat resembling the common
    ash (<i>Fraxinus</i>). It is a pretty, hardy, ornamental
    tree, thriving only in moist soils. Seeds on winged nuts
    produced in long, drooping racemes, but of no special
    value. Introduced into England from Caucasus in 1800,
    and now plentiful here in nurseries.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chestnut.</span>&mdash;See <a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapter V</a>; also <a href="#Horse-chestnut.">Horse-chestnut</a>,

<p><span class="smcap">Chocolate nut or bean.</span>&mdash;The seeds of a small
    tropical tree, <i>Theobroma Cacao</i>, of the chocolate nut
    family (<i>Sterculiaceæ</i>). Indigenous to tropical America,
    but now cultivated more or less extensively in all hot
    climates. The tree grows from fifteen to twenty feet
    high, with long, pointed, smooth leaves. The flowers
    are small, yellow, and produced from the old wood of
    both stems and branches, succeeded by a pod-like fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span> six to ten or more inches long, containing fifty to a hundred
    seeds, resembling beans more than they do nuts.
    When the fruit is ripe it is gathered, at which time the
    seeds are covered with a gum-like substance, and to
    remove this they are subjected to a slight fermentation,
    after which they are dried in the sun, this giving them
    their usual brown color. Chocolate nut trees are extensively
    cultivated in Brazil, New Grenada, Trinidad, and,
    in fact, throughout tropical America, and their cultivation
    is, upon the whole, very profitable, as the demand
    is almost unlimited.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Clearing nut.</span>&mdash;This is an East India name for
    the seeds of <i>Strychnos potatorum</i>, a plant belonging to
    the well-known nux vomica family (<i>Loganiaceæ</i>). It is
    a small tree, native of India, the wood of which is used
    for various purposes. The fruit is about the size of a
    cherry, and contains one seed; this is dried, and used
    for clearing muddy water, this being effected by rubbing
    one of the little nuts around the sides of the vessel that
    is to be filled, after which the water is poured in, and
    then, through some unknown agency, all the foreign
    matter settles, leaving the liquid perfectly pure, clear
    and wholesome.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cocoanut.</span>&mdash;One of the most widely-known and
    largest of edible nuts; the product of <i>Cocos nucifera</i>, a
    lofty, tree-like palm (<i>Palmæ</i> or <i>Palmaceæ</i>). It is a
    native of tropical Africa, India, Malay, and of nearly all
    the islands of the Indian and Pacific oceans. It only
    thrives near the seacoast or where the sea breezes reach
    it, requiring no special care after the nuts and young
    plants once become established in a congenial soil. The
    coco palm grows from fifty to one hundred feet high,
    with pinnate leaves from ten to twenty feet long. The
    nuts are produced in clusters of a dozen or more, and
    when full grown are somewhat triangular and a foot
    long, the outer coat or husk composed of a tough fiber.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> The nuts, when cleaned of their husks, are too well
    known to call for a further description here. In countries
    where these nuts are plentiful, their contents
    form nearly the entire food of the natives, the milky
    fluid serving for drink, and the more solid parts as
    a substitute for meat and bread. The cocoa-nut
    utilized in more ways, and for a greater variety of
    purposes, than any other kind known, and it would
    require a volume to briefly enumerate them. Of recent
    years there have been plantations made of this nut on
    the coast of southern Florida, and one of the most
    extensive of these is by a man from New Jersey, but I
    have not heard from him of late, or seen any reports
    as to the results of his experiments. It is reported
    that there are about 250,000 cocoa-nut trees now growing
    in Florida.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cocoanut, Double.</span>&mdash;This is the fruit of another
    lofty palm, <i>Lodoicea Sechellarum</i>, and is usually considered
    the largest member of the order. It is a native of
    the Seychelles islands, in the Indian ocean. It is said
    to reach a hight of a hundred feet, with a stem two feet
    in diameter. The fruit is a large, oblong nut, with a
    rather thin rind or husk, and when this is removed the
    nut appears to be double, or two oblong nuts firmly
    united, a kind of twin formation, the entire nut weighing
    from thirty to forty pounds. These immense nuts
    are produced in bunches of eight to ten, the cluster
    sometimes weighing from three to four hundred pounds.
    It is supposed that these nuts require about ten years to
    grow and mature. They are useless as food, but the
    shells are manufactured into various useful articles by
    the natives, and they are also transported to other countries
    and valued as curiosities. There is a great demand
    for the leaves of this palm for making hats, baskets, etc.,
    and as the trees have to be cut down to obtain them,
    they are becoming rather scarce.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Cola_nut" id="Cola_nut">Cola nut</a>, Kola nut or Goora nut.</span>&mdash;The fruit
    of a small tree, native of the warmer parts of western
    Africa, and known to botanists as <i>Cola acuminata</i>, and
    of the Sterculiad family (<i>Sterculiaceæ</i>). In its native
    country it grows thirty to forty feet high. The leaves
    are oblong-elliptical, six to eight inches long, and pointed
    (acuminate), and from this it probably derived its specific
    name. The flowers are yellow, and produced in
    axillary racemes, and succeeded by simple bean-like
    pods, each containing several nut-like seeds, which the
    natives call cola or goora nuts. These nuts have long
    been an article of trade among the native tribes of Africa,
    they being valued for their supposed efficacy in allaying
    thirst, promoting digestion, giving strength, and preventing
    exhaustion during the performance of hard manual
    labor. This tree was early introduced into the West
    Indies and Brazil, but its reputation in Africa does not
    appear to have been sustained it its Western habitat.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Coquilla nut.</span>&mdash;The fruit of the Piassaba palm, <i>Attalea funifera</i>, a native of Brazil, where it grows
    about thirty feet high. The fruit is produced in
    bunches, and are each about three inches long, covered
    with a thin rind. The nut is very hard, and is used as
    a substitute for bone and ivory in the manufacture of
    articles for the household.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Coquito_nut." id="Coquito_nut.">Coquito nut.</a></span>&mdash;This is the fruit of the wing-leaved
    palm of Chile, <span class="smcap">Jubæa spectabilis</span>. It is a moderately
    tall species, and closely resembles, in general habit, the
    date palm. The nuts are edible, but they are of secondary
    importance, this palm being valued mainly for
    the sweet sap issuing from the stem when cut down,
    this continuing to exude from it for weeks after it is
    severed from the roots. The sap is gathered and boiled,
    and when reduced to the consistency of molasses becomes
    an article of commerce, under the name of Meil de Palma
    or palm honey.</p>

    low-growing, herbaceous plant of the carrot family
    (<i>Umbelliferæ</i>), common in waste or uncultivated grounds
    in Great Britain and other countries of northern Europe.
    Formerly botanists supposed there were two species, but
    of late only one, the <i>Bunium bulbocastanum</i>. On the roots there are
    small, nut-like tubers, of a sweetish taste, and they are eaten by children,
    either in the raw state or after being roasted. These tubers have various local
    names, and in addition to the above, they are called kipper nuts, and pig nuts
    in England, but a familiar local name in Scotland is lousy nuts, because it is
    said that eating them is sure to breed lice. But this story may have been
    invented by parents to deter their children from digging and eating the roots of
    wild plants. Willdenow, in naming this species, certainly recognized its edible
    qualities, and that children were fond of it, else he would not have called it
    an earth chestnut,&mdash;<i>bulbo</i>,
    bulb, and <i>castanum</i> from <i>castanea</i>, the chestnut.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Fox_nut." id="Fox_nut.">Fox nut.</a></span>&mdash;The seeds of a floating, annual aquatic
    plant, the <i>Euryale ferox</i>, native of India, and belonging
    to the water lily family (<i>Nymphæaceæ</i>). It is a handsome
    plant, with leaves about two feet in diameter, of a rich
    purple on the underside, with thorn-like spines on the
    veins. Flowers deep violet-red. The seeds of this species
    are eaten by the natives, the same as the aborigines
    of this country gathered the seeds of our indigenous <i>Nelumbium luteum</i>, under the name of water chinquapin,
    using them for food in the late fall and winter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ginkgo nut.</span>&mdash;The large, round, white, somewhat
    flattened, nut-like seeds of the now common maidenhair
    tree, or <i>Ginkgo biloba</i>, also known as <i>Salisburia adiantifolia</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> of some nurserymen's catalogues and many recent
    botanical works. The former, however, is the older
    and correct scientific name. This tree is a native of
    China and Japan, and of a slender, sparsely branched
    habit, growing from fifty to eighty feet high in its native
    countries. It is a deciduous, cone-bearing (<i>Coniferæ</i>)
    tree, with two-lobed, fan-shaped leaves two to three
    inches broad, divided about halfway down from the top.
    The male and female flowers are on separate trees, and
    to secure seed or nuts both sexes must be grown near
    together. The ginkgo was introduced into European
    gardens in 1754, and there are now many fruiting specimens,
    especially in France, from whence the nuts have
    long been secured for planting, by nurserymen and
    others interested in tree culture. There are very few
    bearing trees in this country, and one in Washington,
    D. C., has been fruiting for a number of years. In
    China and Japan the seeds or nuts are valued for their
    edible qualities, but they have a kind of disagreeable,
    balsamic taste in their raw state, although this is dispelled
    by roasting, after which they are quite sweet and
    palatable. As the trees do not begin to bear until of
    considerable age, and the nuts are inferior to many other
    kinds, I do not think the ginkgo will ever become very
    popular in this country as a nut tree.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Goora nut.</span>&mdash;See <a href="#Cola_nut">Cola nut</a>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gorgon nut.</span>&mdash;See <a href="#Fox_nut.">Fox nut</a>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Groundnut.</span>&mdash;The small, globular tubers of the
    dwarf three-leaved ginseng, <i>Aralia trifolia</i>, are called
    groundnuts in some of our Northern States, and they
    are frequently sought for, dug up and eaten by children,
    as I know from personal experience. The plant belongs
    to the ginseng family (<i>Araliaceæ</i>), and is closely related
    to the true five-leaved ginseng (<i>Aralia quinquefolia</i>),
    but our groundnut has only three leaves, instead of
    five; besides, it is a somewhat smaller plant, rarely more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> than six to eight inches high. When the scattered seed
    sprout in spring, they send down a long, slender, thread-like
    rootstock, to a depth of from four to six inches, and
    at the bottom of this the small tuber is produced. It
    has a somewhat pungent taste, but this only whets the
    appetite of a boy when on a hunt for ground nuts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Groundnut.</span>&mdash;The tubers of one of the most widely
    distributed climbing plants of the Eastern States, and
    common in low, wet grounds almost everywhere, from
    Canada to Florida, and westward to the Mississippi.
    This plant is described in most of the botanical works
    of the present day under the name of <i>Apios tuberosa</i>,
    and it belongs to the Pulse family (<i>Leguminosæ</i>), and
    is closely related to the common and well-known wistarias,
    although much smaller and of a more slender habit.
    It is a smooth, perennial, twining vine, with pinnate
    leaves, and dense racemes or clusters of small brownish-purple
    pea-shaped flowers. The subterranean rootstocks
    bear long strings of edible tubers, from one to two inches
    long, and from an inch to an inch and a half in diameter,
    somewhat variable in shape, dark brown on the
    outside, but white within. When boiled or roasted
    these tubers have a rich, farinaceous, nutty flavor.
    This tuber or groundnut is the one described by Mr.
    Thomas Herriot, the historiographer of Sir Walter
    Raleigh's expedition to Virginia in 1585, under the Indian
    name of &quot;Openawk.&quot; He says: &quot;These roots
    are round, some as large as walnuts, others much larger;
    they grow in damp soil, many hanging together, as fixed
    on ropes; they are good food, either boiled or roasted.&quot;
    These tubers are to be found in the swamps and damp
    soils of Virginia at this day, just as they were at the
    time of Herriot's visit, but many modern historians have
    tried to make out that Raleigh's colonists found our
    common potato among the Indians at that time, although
    I have never been able to find a scrap of trustworthy history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> to support such a claim, or that Raleigh himself
    ever planted or cultivated the American potato in Ireland
    or England, or, in fact, ever tasted one of these
    tubers.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Groundnut.</span>&mdash;See <a href="#Peanut">Peanut or Goober</a>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hazelnut, or Chile hazel.</span>&mdash;This is merely a
    local English name for the fruit of a small evergreen
    tree, native of Chile, S. A., where it is known as Guevina,
    and this has been adopted as the name of the genus,
    adding the specific name of the European hazel, so we
    have <i>Guevina Avellana</i>, although in some botanical
    works it may be found under the name of <i>Qudria heterophylla</i>.
    It belongs to the Protea family (<i>Proteaceæ</i>).
    It has white, hermaphrodite flowers, in long axillary
    racemes; these are succeeded by coral-red fruit about
    the size of a large cherry; the stone or nut-like seeds
    being edible are largely used by the Chileans. They are
    said to taste like the hazel, hence the name. Trees are
    hardy in the southwest of England, and would probably
    succeed here in the Southern States. It has been
    planted and found to thrive in California. Readily
    propagated from seed or green cuttings under glass.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Horse-chestnut." id="Horse-chestnut.">Horse-chestnut.</a></span>&mdash;The fruit of a genus of deciduous
    ornamental trees and shrubs, native of Asia and
    North America. The common horse-chestnut, or <i>Æsculus
    Hippocastanum</i>, is a native of Asia, and was introduced
    into Europe over three hundred years ago, its
    large, smooth seeds and prickly husks probably suggesting
    both its common and scientific names, although
    these trees do not even belong to the same order as the
    true edible chestnuts (<i>Castanea</i>), but to the soapworts
    (<i>Sapindaceæ</i>). It is supposed that the prefix, &quot;horse,&quot;
    was derived from a custom among the Turks, of giving
    the nuts to horses as a medicine when these animals
    were afflicted with a cough or inclined to become wind-broken.
    In southern Europe they are sometimes fed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span> cows to increase the flow of milk, and at one time they
    were employed for making paste for book binders.
    They are scarcely edible, although containing considerable
    farinaceous matter, owing to the presence of a bitter
    narcotic principle. Our native species, better known as
    Buckeyes, with both smooth and prickly fruit, are
    equally worthless as food.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ivory nut.</span>&mdash;There are two species of palms producing
    nuts hard enough to be employed as a substitute
    for ivory, in the manufacture of small articles of domestic
    use. But the one best known to commerce under
    the name of ivory nut is the fruit of <i>Phytelephas macrocarpa</i>,
    native of New Granada and other parts of Central
    America. This palm is a low-growing and almost decumbent
    species, the stem seldom more than six to eight
    inches in diameter; but the leaves are of immense length,
    or from fifteen to twenty feet, growing in bundles, or
    clusters. The fruit consists of about forty nuts, enclosed
    in a rough, spiny husk, of a globular form, produced
    on a short footstalk growing from the axis of the
    leaves, the whole bunch weighing from twenty to thirty
    pounds. They are two inches long, slightly triangular,
    and covered with a thin, pulpy coat, which becomes
    dry, papery and brittle when thoroughly dried, but
    when in its green state it is sometimes utilized by the
    natives for making a favorite beverage. The ripe nuts
    are very solid, hard, and when polished resemble ivory.
    Immense quantities of these nuts are imported into this
    country, as well as Europe, and used as a substitute for
    bone and ivory for making buttons, toys, and similar
    small articles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Litchi_nut" id="Litchi_nut">Litchi nut</a> or leechee nut.</span>&mdash;I am inclined to
    think that the affix of &quot;nut&quot; to this Oriental fruit is
    an Americanism, and not used elsewhere. There are
    three distinct species of this fruit known among the
    Chinese, under the name of Litchi, Longan or Long-yen,
    and Rambutan, all the product
    of the Nepheliums, a genus
    of the soapberry family (<i>Sapindaceæ</i>).
    By some of the earlier
    botanical works the litchi is placed
    either in the genus <i>Dimocarpus</i> or <i>Euphoria</i>. Within the past
    few years this fruit has appeared
    in our markets, in consequence
    of the increased trade with Oriental countries, and facilities
    for rapid transit across the continent. The litchi is
    a globular fruit, about one inch in diameter (Fig. 103),
    with a thin, chocolate-brown colored shell covered with
    wart-like protuberances. When fresh the shell is filled
    with a white, jelly-like pulp, in the center of which
    there is one rather large, smooth brown seed. The pulp
    is of a most delicious sub-acid flavor, but it is often
    rather dry and stale in the nuts which reach us from
    China and Japan. The tree producing this fruit is seldom
    more than twenty-five feet high, with rather sturdy
    twigs and branches, the leaves composed of about seven
    oblong pointed leaflets. This is said to be one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span> most popular of Oriental fruits, and the trees would
    probably succeed in many of the Southern States and in
    California. It is now on trial in Florida, having been
    introduced there in 1886. It has been fruited in England
    many times, but always under glass, where the
    plants receive protection and artificial heat. A full
    description of this species, accompanied by a superb colored
    plate of the <i>Nephelium</i> or <i>Dimocarpus Longana</i>, appeared
    in the &quot;Transactions of the London Horticultural
    Society,&quot; 1818, p. 402. There are not only a large number
    of species of the Nepheliums bearing edible fruit,
    but, as might be expected from their long and extensive
    cultivation, many local varieties, especially in the southern
    provinces of China and throughout the islands of
    tropical Asia. The Dawa of the Fiji islands is the fruit
    of <i>N. pinnatum</i>, a tree growing sixty feet high, and
    forming extensive forests on those islands. At some
    future time we may be receiving the dawas under the
    name of Fiji nuts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lousy nut.</span>&mdash;See <a href="#earth_chestnut">Earth chestnut</a>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Marking nut.</span>&mdash;The seeds of <i>Semecarpus Anacardium</i>,
    an evergreen tree of the cashew-nut family (<i>Anacardiaceæ</i>),
    native of tropical Asia, and especially Ceylon.
    It has large, oblong leaves, and grows about fifty
    feet high, and the fruit is produced on a fleshy receptacle.
    The natives roast and eat these nuts, and the black
    juice obtained from the green fruit is used for marking
    cloth, hence the common name. The juice is also mixed
    with lime to make an excellent indelible ink, also for a
    kind of varnish.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Miriti nut or ita palm nut.</span>&mdash;These are the
    Indian names of the fruit of a lofty palm tree, the <i>Mauritia
    flexuosa</i>, of the swamps along the Orinoco river,
    also in wet soils at higher elevations. This giant palm
    grows to a hight of a hundred and fifty feet, with an
    immense crown of large, fan-shaped leaves, and just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> beneath these the fruit appears in a pendulous cluster
    eight to ten feet long, containing several bushels, weighing,
    altogether, from one to three hundred pounds.
    The individual nuts are about the size of an ordinary
    apple, with a very smooth shell, somewhat veined or
    streaked. The natives of the country not only use the
    farinaceous kernels of these nuts as food, but obtain a
    saccharine material from the pith, out of which they
    make wine by fermentation. The petioles of the leaves
    also furnish them with a strong fiber, used as thread-cord,
    and for various other purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Myrobalan_nut." id="Myrobalan_nut.">Myrobalan nut.</a></span>&mdash;This name is applied rather
    indiscriminately to the fruits of several species of the
    genus <i>Terminalia</i>, which are, in the main, large trees of
    the Myrobalan family (<i>Combretaceæ</i>). They are native
    of India, Malay, Fiji, and, in fact, almost all the islands
    of the Pacific in warm latitudes. The fruits are similar
    to large plums, but slightly angular, containing a hard,
    nut-like seed. They are used principally for tanning
    leather, and also for making ink similar to that made
    from oak galls. The kernels of all the species are edible,
    and are eaten by the natives. In the Fiji islands
    the <i>Terminalia Catappa</i> is a favorite tree with the natives,
    and they plant it near the houses. The kernels of this
    species have the flavor of the sweet almond.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nickar nut.</span>&mdash;The seeds of two species of <i>Guilandina</i>,
    a genus of the bean family (<i>Leguminosæ</i>). They
    are climbing plants, with hard-wooded, prickly stems,
    forming almost impenetrable thickets near the seacoast
    in the East Indies and other tropical countries. They
    have become widely distributed, as the pods readily float
    when they drop into the water. The pods are about
    three inches long, very prickly, containing seeds or nuts
    about the size of small marbles, and exceedingly hard;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> but in time the water softens them, after which they
    sprout and grow when cast upon the shore by the waves.
    The two species are distinguished mainly by the color of
    the nuts, those of <i>G. Bonduc</i> being yellow, and those of <i>G. Bonducella</i> gray, or with a reddish tint. Of no value
    or use except as botanical curiosities.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Nitta or nutta nut.</span>&mdash;The native African name
    of the seeds of <i>Parkia Africana</i>, a tree of the sensitive-tree
    section of the bean family (<i>Leguminosæ</i>). It grows
    about forty feet high, and has compound winged leaves.
    It has become naturalized in the West Indies. The
    pods grow in clusters, the seeds imbedded in a yellowish,
    sweet pulp, like the carob or St. John's bread, and the
    negroes are very fond of them. In the Soudan the seeds
    are roasted, and then allowed to ferment in water until
    they are soft and putrid, after which they are washed,
    pounded and dried, then made up into cakes to be used
    as a sauce for different kinds of food. It is supposed
    that the African traveler, Mungo Park, first brought
    these seeds or nuts to the notice of Europeans, and
    Robert Brown named the genus <i>Parkia</i> in his honor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Nutmeg." id="Nutmeg.">Nutmeg.</a></span>&mdash;A name applied to the fruits of a large
    number of trees, and of different orders of plants. The
    true nutmegs of commerce are the fruits of trees belonging
    to the genus <i>Myristica</i>, and of the family <i>Myristicaceæ</i>.
    The oldest and best known of these is the <i>M.
    fragrans</i>, a small, widely branching tree, growing
    twenty to twenty-five feet high, and supposed to be
    indigenous to the Indian Archipelago. The fruit is
    about the size of an ordinary walnut, with a thick rind,
    which, upon opening, at maturity, discloses a reddish
    aril covering the nut within. This aril or husk is the
    mace of commerce, while the true nutmeg is the center
    or hard seed (nut). The Brazil nutmeg is longer than
    the true species, and is sold under the name of long nutmeg,
    and is the fruit of <i>M. fatua</i>. Another species, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> <i>M. otoba</i>, is cultivated in Madagascar, but is scarcely
    known in commerce.</p>
<p>Another species, the <i>M. sebifera</i>, is a common tree
    in the forests of Guiana, North Brazil, and up into
    Panama. It is utilized principally for the oil extracted
    from the nuts, obtained by macerating them in water,
    the oil rising to the surface, and as it cools skimmed off.</p>
<p>The seeds of several species of conifers and laurels
    are known, either locally or in commerce, as nutmegs,
    or are used as a substitute for the true nutmeg. There
    are three different kinds of trees, native of Guiana, in
    addition to the one already named, the seeds of which
    are employed as a spice or medicine. One of these is
    the <i>Acrodiclidium camara</i>. These nuts are known in
    commerce as &quot;Ackawai nutmegs,&quot; and are used mainly
    as a cure for diarrhœa and colic. Another is the seed
    of the <i>Aydendron Cujumary</i> tree, and they are known
    in commerce as &quot;Cujumary beans,&quot; although they are
    not, strictly speaking, a bean, and the same is true of
    the so-called &quot;Puchurim beans,&quot; from the same country,
    for they are the fruit of <i><a name="Nectandy_Puchury" id="Nectandy_Puchury">Nectandy Puchury</a></i>, a small tree
    of the laurel family. They are used as a tonic, and considered
    highly stimulating.</p>
<p><i>Clove Nutmeg</i>, or Madagascar nutmeg of commerce,
    is the fruit of <i>Agathophyllum aromaticum</i>, a
    small evergreen tree, indigenous to Madagascar.</p>
<p><i>Brazilian Nutmegs</i> are the highly aromatic seeds
    of <i>Cryptocarya moschata</i>, or <i>Atherosperma moschata</i> of
    some botanists. It is a lofty tree, native of Brazil. The
    aromatic nuts are used as a substitute for nutmegs, but
    are very inferior to the genuine.</p>
<p><i><a name="Peruvian_Nutmeg" id="Peruvian_Nutmeg">Peruvian Nutmeg</a>, or Plum Nutmeg.</i>&mdash;The seeds
    of a large evergreen tree with aromatic foliage, like our
    common sassafras, and for this reason is sometimes
    called Chilean or Peruvian sassafras. The seeds are of
    no more economic value than those of our native sassafras.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> It is known under various botanical names, but <i>Laurelia sempervirens</i> is, perhaps, the most familiar.</p>
<p><i>California Nutmeg</i>, or <i>Stinking Nutmeg</i>, is the
    nut-like seed of <i>Torreya Californica</i>, a small tree of
    the yew family (<i>Taxaceæ</i>). The fruit is from an inch
    to an inch and a half long, with a fleshy rind enclosing
    a hard, long nut, which is slightly grooved like a nutmeg.
    The fruit, leaves and wood are strongly scented,
    hence the name of &quot;stinking nutmeg,&quot; or &quot;stinking
    yew.&quot; Another species, the <i>T. taxifolia</i>, is a native of
    Florida.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Oil_nut." id="Oil_nut.">Oil nut.</a></span>&mdash;The fruit of a low-branching, deciduous
    native shrub, growing three to ten feet high, with alternate
    leaves and small greenish flowers in terminal spikes.
    It is the <i>Pyrularia oleifera</i> of Gray, and <i>Hamiltonia
    oleifera</i> of Muhlenberg. The fruit is in the form of a
    pear-shaped drupe, about an inch long, the small seed
    or nut with an oily kernel of strong acrid taste; of no
    value. This shrub is found on shady banks in the
    mountains of Pennsylvania, and southward into Georgia.</p>

    fruit of <i>Arachis hypogæa</i>, a low-growing annual belonging
    to the pulse or pea family (<i>Leguminosæ</i>), supposed
    to be a native of South America, but now extensively
    cultivated in nearly all semi-tropical countries and
    wherever the summers are long enough to insure the
    ripening of the seeds. Extensively cultivated in Virginia,

<p><span class="smcap">Physic nut.</span>&mdash;The seeds of <i>Jatropha Curcas</i>, a
    small tree of the spurgewort family (<i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>). It
    is native of some of the West Indies and warmer parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span> of South America, but now cultivated in other tropical
    countries for its seeds, which yield an oil used for the
    same purposes as castor oil, but rather more powerful
    and drastic. The seeds have a nutty flavor, but are
    rather dangerous if eaten in any considerable quantities,
    and death has been known to follow excess in this
    direction.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Physic nut.</span>&mdash;In &quot;Bartram's Travels,&quot; he refers
    to a seed or nut of a plant he found growing in Florida
    under this name, p. 41, as follows: &quot;... some
    very curious new shrubs and plants, particularly the
    physic nut or Indian olive. The stems arise, many from
    a root, two or three feet high; the leaves sit opposite,
    on very short petioles; they are broad, lanceolate, entire
    and undulated, having a smooth surface, of a deep green
    color. From the bosom of each leaf is produced a single
    oval drupe, standing erect on long slender stems; it
    has a large kernel and thin pulp. The fruit is yellow
    when ripe, and about the size of an olive. The Indians,
    when they go in pursuit of deer, carry this fruit with
    them, supposing that it has the power of charming or
    drawing that creature to them, from whence, with
    traders, it has obtained the name of physic nut, which
    means, with them, charming, conjuring or fascinating.&quot;</p>
<p>To what kind of fruit Bartram referred under the
    name of &quot;physic nut,&quot; is not certain, but his description
    of the plant comes very near that of the American
    olive (<i>Olea Americana</i>), but the fruit of this and other
    closely allied plants of the same family are not &quot;yellow&quot;
    when ripe, but purple.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pignut, or hognut.</span>&mdash;See chapter on <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">Hickory</a>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pine nut.</span>&mdash;A name applied indiscriminately to
    the many species of pine trees (<i>Pinus</i>) bearing seeds
    large enough to be conveniently used as food. In southern
    Europe, and especially in Italy and the south of
    France, the seeds of the stone pine (<i>Pinus Pinea</i>) have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> been extensively used as food, from the earliest times
    down to the present day. Nearly all the ancient authors
    refer to them as among the valuable products of the
    country. Macrobius, in his story of the <i>Saturnalia</i>,
    speaks of the cones as <i>Nuces vel Poma Pinea</i>. These
    pine nuts are called <i>Pinocchi</i> in Italy and Sicily, and
    occasionally a few reach this country, where the Italian
    name has been corrupted into Pinolas. These seeds or
    nuts are used for desserts, puddings and cakes, also
    eaten raw at table,
    as with almonds.
    They have a slight
    taste of turpentine,
    but it is not strong
    enough to be at all
    disagreeable.</p>

<p>In this country
    we have several native
    species bearing
    very large edible
    seeds, and they are
    known in the West
    under the general
    name of <i>Piñon</i>, or
    nut pines. The
    best of these nuts,
    to my taste, are the
    seeds of <i>Pinus
    edulis</i>, so named
    by the late Dr. Engelmann, because of its large, sweet
    and edible seeds. It is a small, low-growing tree, more
    or less common on dry hills and slopes, from Colorado
    southward through New Mexico, and into western
    Texas. The seeds of <i>Pinus Parryana</i> and <i>Pinus cembroides</i>,
    of Arizona and Lower California, are also called
    Piñons, and largely gathered by the Indians. Farther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> east and north, we find the one-leaved pine (<i>Pinus monophylla</i>),
    and although the seeds are much smaller than
    those of <i>P. edulis</i>, they were formerly gathered in immense
    quantities by the Indians, to help eke out their
    often scanty winter store of food. Occasionally a small
    quantity of these pine nuts is sent to Eastern markets,
    but rarely, unless ordered early in the season. The trees
    of <i>P. edulis</i> and <i>P. monophylla</i> are perfectly hardy here,
    and worth cultivating for ornament, as well as their
    nuts, although their slow growth is a rather severe test
    of one's patience. Fig. 104 shows a Piñon branch.</p>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Pistachio_nut." id="Pistachio_nut.">Pistachio nut.</a></span>&mdash;Historically, this is a very ancient
    nut, for Bible commentators claim that it is the one sent
    by Jacob into Egypt. It is the fruit of a small, deciduous
    tree of the cashew family (<i>Anacardiaceæ</i>), a native
    of western Asia, but many centuries ago it had become
    naturalized in Palestine and throughout the Mediterranean
    regions. It has shining evergreen winged leaves,
    and the bark on the young twigs is brown, becoming
    russet-colored with age. There are several different
    species, but the one producing the nuts of commerce is
    the <i>Pistacia vera</i>, having brownish-green flowers in
    loose panicles, and these are succeeded by bunches of
    reddish fruit, about an inch long, with an oblique or
    bent point. The nuts have a double shell, the outer
    one usually red, the inner one smooth and brittle; the
    kernel is pale green, sweet, and of rather pleasant taste.
    There are a number of varieties, differing only slightly
    in form and size. This nut has been cultivated sparingly
    in Great Britain since 1570, but the climate is not
    quite warm enough to insure its ripening in the open
    air. It would probably succeed throughout the greater
    part of California, as well as in the extreme Southern
    States, but Mr. Berckmans writes me that it is not
    hardy in his grounds at Augusta, Ga. There is a species
    of pistacia known as <i>P. Mexicana</i>, found in central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> Mexico, and extending as far north as San Diego, in
    California, according to the report of Dr. Cooper (Botany
    of California, Vol. I, p. 109).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Quandang nut.</span>&mdash;A medium size Australian tree,
    the <i>Santalum acuminatum</i>, of the sandalwood family
    (<i>Santalaceæ</i>). It produces a plum-like fruit, which is
    best known in its native country as the quandang nut.
    It is used as a preserve, but is little known, except in
    or near its native habitats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Sapucaia_nut." id="Sapucaia_nut.">Sapucaia nut.</a></span>&mdash;The Brazilian name of, at least,
    two species of large forest trees growing in the valley of
    the Amazon and its tributaries.
    The best known of these is the <i>Lecythis Zabucajo</i>, a lofty tree of
    the myrtle family (<i>Myrtaceæ</i>). It
    is closely allied to the more common
    Brazil nut of commerce. The
    sapucaia nuts are produced in an
    urn-shaped, woody capsule, which
    has received the name of Monkey-pot,
    because when these capsules
    ripen the lid at the top is suddenly
    liberated, emitting a sharp sound,
    which, as heard by the monkeys,
    gives them notice that the nuts are
    falling, and that the first on the
    ground becomes the fortunate possessor
    of the largest number. The
    capsules or pots are about six
    inches in diameter, and the lid opening at the top about
    two inches. The nuts, which are packed very closely in
    the shell, are about one inch in diameter, and two to
    three in length, with a thin, brown, and very much
    wrinkled and twisted shell (Fig. 105). The kernel is
    white, sweet, oily, and somewhat more delicate in flavor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> than that of the common Brazil nut. In New York
    city these nuts are sold under the name of Paradise
    nuts. But this is probably only a local name, for I
    have been unable to find it in any botanical work.
    These nuts rarely come to this country in any considerable
    quantities; a few hundred pounds at a time would
    be considered a large consignment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snake nut.</span>&mdash;A large, roundish fruit, about the
    size of the black walnut, the product of the <i>Ophiocaryon
    paradoxum</i>, a large tree of the soapberry family (<i>Sapindaceæ</i>),
    native of British Guiana. This nut takes its
    name of &quot;Snake nut,&quot; from the peculiar form of the
    embryo of the seed, which is curled up spirally. The
    Indians, thinking there must be some virtue in form,
    use these nuts as an antidote for snake bites, although,
    so far as known to science, they do not possess any
    medicinal properties.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"> <img src="images/fig106.jpg" alt="" height="451" width="450" /> <span class="caption"><a name="FIG._106" id="FIG._106">FIG. 106</a>. SOUARI NUT.</span> </div>
<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Souari_nut" id="Souari_nut">Souari nut</a>, or butternut.</span>&mdash;This nut, like the
    last, is a native of British Guiana, and is the fruit of the <i>Caryocar nuciferum</i>, a noble tree, growing a hundred
    feet high, having large, broad, trifoliate leaves, resembling
    those of our common horse-chestnut, but not
    quite as broad. The flowers are very large, and, with
    the tube, fully a foot long, of a deep purple on the outside,
    and yellow within. They are composed of five
    thick, fleshy petals, and as showy as some of our best
    and brightest-colored magnolias. The flowers are produced
    in terminal clusters or corymbs, succeeded by a
    large, round, four-celled fleshy fruit five to six inches in
    diameter; but as some of the embryo nuts usually fail
    to grow, it changes the form of the fruit as it enlarges
    towards maturity, and only one or two of the nuts mature
    and ripen, very much as frequently occurs in both
    the sweet and horse-chestnuts. The nuts are affixed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> a central axis, and are of a rounded, subreniform shape,
    and even flattened to an almost sharp edge on one side,
    and broadly truncate at the scar (hilum) where they are
    attached to the pericarp or central axis. The shell is of
    a deep brown color, embossed, as it were, with smooth
    tubercles. They are from two to two and a half inches
    or more in their broadest diameter, as shown in Fig. 106.
    The kernel or meat is pure white, soft, rich and oily,
    with a pleasant flavor. This nut is a rarity in our markets,
    and Mr. H. R. Davy of New York, to whom I am
    indebted for a specimen, as well as other rare kinds,
    assures me that in his forty-five years' experience as a
    dealer in foreign fruits and nuts, he has never known of
    but one lot, and that one consisted of about one-half
    bushel, brought into his store by a sailor, who only knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> their common South American name. These nuts are
    more frequently seen in European seaports than in those
    of this country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Tahitian_chestnut." id="Tahitian_chestnut.">Tahitian chestnut.</a></span>&mdash;The seeds of a tree known
    in the South Sea islands by the native name of Toi, but
    to botanists as <i>Inocarpus edulis</i>. It belongs to the bean
    family (<i>Leguminosæ</i>). The tree grows sixty to eighty
    feet high, and when young the stems are fluted like a
    Grecian column, but as they increase with age the projections
    extend outward, until they form a kind of buttress
    all around the lower part, gradually decreasing
    upward. This so-called chestnut tree has yellow flowers,
    succeeded by fibrous pods containing one large seed or
    nut, which, when roasted or boiled, resembles the chestnut
    in taste. The nuts have a different local name in
    almost every one of the Pacific islands where it is at all
    abundant.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tavola nut.</span>&mdash;See <a href="#Myrobalan_nut.">Myrobalan nut</a>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tallow nut.</span>&mdash;A local and nearly obsolete name
    for the fruit of the Ogeechee lime or sour gum tree
    (<i>Nyssa capitata</i>) of the swamps of Florida, Georgia and
    westward. The fruit is about an inch long, resembling
    a small plum, the pulp having an agreeable acid taste.
    Bartram, p. 94, refers to this fruit under the name of
    &quot;Tallow nut,&quot; but why so called is not explained.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tallow nut.</span>&mdash;The fruit of the Chinese Tallow
    tree, <i>Stillingia sebifera</i>, of the spurgewort family
    (<i>Euphorbiaceæ</i>), a native of China, where it is, as well
    as in some of the warmer parts of America, extensively
    cultivated. It has been planted in a few localities in
    the Southern States, and appears to thrive. It is a
    small tree thirty to forty feet high, with rhomboid
    tapering leaves and a three-celled capsuled fruit, each
    cell containing only a single seed thickly coated with a
    yellow, tallow-like substance, hence its common name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span> This tallow or grease is used for making soap, burning

<p><span class="smcap">Temperance nut.</span>&mdash;An English name of <a href="#Cola_nut">cola nut</a>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Torrey nut.</span>&mdash;The hard, nut-like seeds of <i>Torreya
    nucifera</i>, of Siebold, or <i>Taxus nucifera</i>, of Kæmpfer,
    and <i>Caryotaxus nucifera</i>, of Zuccarini, a tree native of
    Japan, where these nuts are eaten by the Japanese,
    either raw or roasted. An oil is also extracted from the
    nuts, for use in cooking or for burning in lamps. This
    Japanese tree belongs to the same genus as the so-called
    California nutmeg (see <a href="#Nutmeg.">Nutmeg</a>) and our Florida stinking
    cedar (<i>T. taxifolia</i>), also the great Chinese cedar
    (<i>T. grandis</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a name="Water_chestnut." id="Water_chestnut.">Water chestnut.</a></span>&mdash;Also known as water caltrops.
    The seeds of several species of water plants of the genus <i>Trapa</i>, of the
    evening primrose
    family
    (<i>Onagraceæ</i>).
    In southern
    Europe and
    eastward there
    is a species
    found in ponds,
    the seeds of which are called Jesuit chestnuts (<i>T. natans</i>),
    and in India and Ceylon a closely allied one,
    the Singhara-nut plant (<i>T. bispinosa</i>), while in Lago
    Maggiore there is another (<i>T. verbanensis</i>), but all may
    be varieties of one and the same species, including the <i>Trapa bicornis</i>, a two-horned water chestnut, extensively
    used in China and Japan as food under various
    local names. In China they are called Ling, and of
    late years have been occasionally imported and sold,
    more as curiosities than for eating. These seeds or nuts
    are of a dark brown color, and of the form and size
    shown in Fig. 107, resembling, in miniature, the skull of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> an ox with abbreviated horns. When fresh, the kernel
    is of an agreeable nutty flavor.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Water chestnut, or chinquapin.</span>&mdash;The seeds of
    the large yellow water lily (<i>Nelumbium luteum</i>), a very
    common plant in small ponds in the West and South,
    but more rare in the East. The seeds are about the size
    and shape of small acorns, and produced in a large, top-shaped,
    fleshy receptacle. They are edible, and are supposed
    to have been extensively used as food by the aborigines
    of this country.</p>

<blockquote>

        in America. The author describes how he grows Mushrooms, and
        how they are grown for profit by the leading market gardeners, and
        for home use by the most successful private growers. Engravings
        drawn from nature expressly for this work. By Wm. Falconer.

<blockquote>

        also be found convenient for references in regard to many questions
        that may arise in crop growing, aside from the special subjects

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
